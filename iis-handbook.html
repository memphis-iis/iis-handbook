<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Welcome to the first version of the IIS Handbook and Operations Manual.
The IIS has never had a book like this before, but as the IIS has grown in scope and complexity,
so has the need for a handbook that documents our programs and procedures.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This first version (17.05 in year/month notation) reflects my personal views that
have developed over the last 10 years as I&#8217;ve served as Associate Director and
eventually Director of the IIS.
Accordingly, the priorities and biases are mine and have not been endorsed by
the IIS community.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My hope is that future versions will be voted into adoption or follow some
similar consensus-building process.
By hosting this handbook on GitHub and using AsciiDoc, I&#8217;ve made it as easy as
I know how for this book to be improved by a distributed group of people,
potentially across many years, such that all revisions are well documented.
This approach is well-traveled by other open source books,
and I&#8217;ve leaned heavily on the model provided by <strong>Pro Git</strong> (2nd edition).
To make changes, please refer to the procedures in the README file in the root
of this repository.</p>

<h2 id="_getting_started">Getting Started</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This chapter provides a common ground for everyone that is assumed for the following chapters.
It gives a high-level view of what the IIS is, what it does, and how it works.
Some of these topics are further developed for student and faculty concerns in later chapters.</p>

<h3 id="_about_the_iis">About the IIS</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What is the Institute for Intelligent Systems?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Institute for Intelligent Systems (IIS) is an interdisciplinary research center at the University of Memphis.
Unlike many research centers, the IIS has historically pursued a research agenda
set by participating researchers who <strong>self-organize around research problems</strong>,
rather than a highly focused formal agenda.
The breadth and flexibility of the IIS are reflected in our current mission statement:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Institute for Intelligent Systems is dedicated to advancing the state of knowledge and capabilities of intelligent systems, including psychological, biological, and artificial systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By conducting cutting-edge research and publishing our findings in peer-reviewed venues, we contribute to the discipline and, ultimately, to the public. In doing so, we are also training the next generation of scientists.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our mission depends on an interdisciplinary approach that brings together researchers from many different backgrounds, including computer science, cognitive psychology, education, philosophy, linguistics, engineering, English, and biology.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock tip">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Tip</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
Our "bottom-up" approach to forming research groups makes the IIS very accessible: if
you can find some like-minded people interested in your project, you can form a group.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although the IIS maintains a strong tradition of bottom-up research, our recent
strategic plan adopted three focus areas:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Language &amp; Discourse</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Artificial Intelligence</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These focus areas represent the deepest areas of <em>current</em> expertise at the IIS,
but they should not be regarded as an intention to exclude other areas of research or
limit what the IIS can become in the future.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_challenge_of_interdisciplinary_research">Challenge of Interdisciplinary Research</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Interdisciplinary research is hard.
To be successful, we have to step outside our disciplinary perspectives and be willing to learn and to be challenged.
This means not only learning about other disciplines, which have their own literature, methods, and approach to knowledge,
but also learning to work on teams with members of other disciplines.
These issues can impact student milestones and professional development, as well as tenure and career advancement for faculty.
Within a university that has traditional departments, interdisciplinary research can challenge typical departmental procedures from both an
academic (e.g., committee composition) and finance (e.g., course buyout) perspective.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_assume_ignorance">Assume Ignorance</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The best policy in interdisciplinary research is to assume a limited understanding of other fields.
To paraphrase Bilbo, you don&#8217;t know half of other fields half as well as you would like;
and you like less than half of other fields half as well as they deserve.
Misunderstandings often arise when researchers use themselves (or members of their field) as a model for researchers in other fields.
The reason this doesn&#8217;t work is that the differences between fields can be quite profound, well beyond the superficial issue of the area or
object of study.
The differences include:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Knowledge</dt>
<dd>
<p>What does it mean to "know" something and how can we arrive at "knowing?"
Not all fields are empirical; not all fields use quantitative research methods.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Language</dt>
<dd>
<p>Each field has its own vocabulary and style of discourse that expresses "knowing."
The same word or phrase may have different meanings across fields,
e.g., "deep learning" means neural networks to computer science, but "deep learning" means durable, semantically interconnected memory to a psychologist.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Scholarly products</dt>
<dd>
<p>What scholarly products does a "successful" researcher produce, and how often?
Some fields give great weight to books; some fields give great weight to conference proceedings.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Student training</dt>
<dd>
<p>How are students trained in the field? What kind of mentoring is expected, and what experiences are students expected to have?
Some fields may expect hundreds or thousands of hours of clinical practice or bench work.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_communicate_the_obvious">Communicate the Obvious</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Perhaps the biggest problem facing interdisciplinary teams is that communication on these issues either doesn&#8217;t happen, or happens late in the project.
Therefore it is a good idea to communicate about what, at first, may seem obvious.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For each researcher</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What questions are interesting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What they can contribute to the project in terms of answering these questions or the questions of others</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many hours they can <strong>really</strong> contribute per week, including meetings, and any "dead" times during the year where they won&#8217;t be contributing much</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What they need to do that year to be successful (e.g., to their department, includes teaching, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What publications are planned</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What mentored students need along the above<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_avoid_the_technician_trap">Avoid the Technician Trap</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Interdisciplinary researchers can contribute to a project in many ways.
Many times, they contribute distinct technical skills related to their field.
While this contribution can be important to the project as a whole, it may not make for a rewarding experience for the researcher.
Application of technical skills may not count as scholarly output and thus not count towards career advancement.
For example, a computer scientist may write software or a psychologist may run an experiment, but these activities in themselves do not
constitute scholarly products.
Moreover, these activities may be <strong>extremely</strong> time consuming and actually prevent the researcher from engaging in other activities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When considering a project, researchers should be aware of the technician trap and consider two key questions</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Can I make this successful</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can this make me successful</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If there are conditions attached to these questions, i.e., to be successful, the researcher will need "X," then this is a worthy topic of discussion
and negotiation on the front end of the project.
For example, a psychologist may need to change the design of the experiment to make it publishable in their field,
while still retaining the characteristics needed to advance the project.
Some give and take is needed in any interdisciplinary project to ensure all researchers can benefit from the project.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_interdisciplinary_norms_for_publishing">Interdisciplinary Norms for Publishing</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Different fields have different norms for publishing.
This can affect who is on the paper, who is first author, and where the paper is published.
It is important to clarify publishing expectations <strong>at the start of the project</strong> when there is no
resource conflict (because the resource, i.e., the opportunity to publish, does not yet exist).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Things to ask:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What are the criteria for authorship</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who will take the lead writing up different results</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who else will be listed as an author on these papers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are students expected/encouraged to publish work on this project</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can a student be first author (assuming that concept is valid; some fields list authors alphabetically)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember, in some fields, non-intellectual contributions (e.g., collecting data) do not warrant authorship, and in others,

<h3 id="_a_short_history_of_the_iis">A Short History of the IIS</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The IIS was formed in 1985 as a result of informal meetings between
Dr. Stan Franklin (Computer Science), Dr. Art Graesser (Psychology),
and Dr. Terry Horgan (Philosophy), with Graesser and Franklin initially serving
as Co-Directors.
Dr. Don Franceschetti (Physics) developed a five-year plan
for the IIS which led to the recognition by the State of Tennessee of the IIS
as an Institute.
The Cognitive Science Seminar began in 1985 and continues to this day.</p>

The Cognitive Science Seminar has been in continuous operation since 1985.
It is now a cross-listed course with Psychology, Philosophy, and Computer Science.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 1998, as a result of multiple major grants to faculty participating in the IIS,
the IIS received an operating budget of $25,000, 5% indirect cost recovery from grants,
and two staff positions that were both filled by 2000.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 2003, the IIS moved to the FedEx Institute of Technology (FIT) and began hiring two
faculty with split appointments between the IIS and other departments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Beginning in 2007, the IIS began hiring 100% faculty lines.
These lines are fully within the IIS but have tenure housed in other departments.
This development marked a number of administrative changes in the IIS as it
continued to grow into a mini-department.
An additional staff person was added to support grant submissions (i.e., pre-award support)
in recognition of the importance of grant funding to the IIS mission.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 2010, the IIS was allocated 10 graduate assistantships, additional faculty lines,
additional staff, 20% indirect cost recovery, and the 4th floor of the FIT.
The IIS Student Organization (IISSO) was formed and tasked with managing student
travel awards.
The IIS added its first degree program, the Cognitive Science Graduate Certificate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 2014, the IIS launched a multi-year strategic planning process.
Many of the recommendations of the strategic planning process have already been
implemented, including a new undergraduate Minor in Cognitive Science.
However, parts of the strategic plan will take years to unfold.</p>

<h3 id="_iis_membership">IIS Membership</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For many years the IIS did not have a formal membership definition.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since 2008, the IIS has had a membership letter mechanism: faculty can join the
IIS as "IIS Affiliates" by signing the letter and returning it to the IIS Director.
The letter states what the Affiliate can expect from the IIS and vice versa.
In a nutshell, the IIS expects participation and, ultimately, grant activity that
funds IIS services.
In return, the Affiliate has access to the various resources the IIS provides.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is not a similar membership letter for students.
Students may join the IIS Student Organization (IISSO) according to the current policies and procedures of
that organization.
However, being a member of the IISSO does not automatically grant access to IIS
resources.
To access IIS resources, students must be "claimed" by an IIS Affiliate faculty
member as described later in this handbook.</p>

<h3 id="_iis_student_organization_iisso">IIS Student Organization (IISSO)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The IIS Student Organization (IISSO) is a self-organized group of students,
most of whom work with IIS Affiliates.
In addition to providing a community for students, the IISSO makes
recommendations to the IIS regarding the allocation of various resources to
students, including student travel awards and thesis/dissertation awards.
The IISSO also organizes the poster session at the Speed Date, guest speaker
lunches, and other social events.</p>

<p>The IISSO is a student-led advocacy and coordinating group at the Institute
for Intelligent Systems (IIS). The IISSO represents the interests of
undergraduate and graduate students that are affiliated with the IIS.
The IISSO actively pursues opportunities to improve student welfare
through academic and social projects and also strives to advance
student research by providing opportunities for funding, networking,
and promotion of research. IISSO meetings are scheduled once or twice a
semester, and all IIS-affiliated students are welcome to attend.
The meeting minutes will be distributed through the IISSO email list within
one week of the meeting. Student elections for the IISSO officers are held
 annually in May.</p>

<h5 id="_qualification_for_membership">Qualification for Membership</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any undergraduate or graduate student affiliated with the IIS or with a strong interest in cognitive science interdisciplinary research is able to join and participate in IISSO events.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Membership does not have any strict requirements. To join, simply email the President to have your name added to the mailing list (MUST be your U of M email). The IISSO strives to advance student research by providing opportunities for funding, networking, and promotion of research. As such, members have access to the following benefits: participation in the IISSO research fair (usually toward the end of the Fall and Spring semesters), the opportunity to collaborate with researchers in different fields, as well as the chance to meet and network with experts from outside of the U of M in a variety of cognitive science fields (through the Cognitive Science Seminar lunches), attend and/or present workshops to further your academic career/CV.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While anyone is welcome to join and may benefit from any or all of the abovementioned benefits of membership, limited travel funding (and thesis/dissertation funding) can be awarded to members who meet certain criteria. Specifically, one must be an IISSO member collaborating on a project with an IIS-approved faculty member. Upon joining the IISSO, if you are interested in possibly applying for travel funding in the future, you should check with your advisor or any professor you are collaborating with to see if they are IIS-affiliated and if they have added their students to the list of IISSO-travel-funding-approved students. Even if you meet this requirement (and others detailed on the travel funding page), no one is guaranteed funding. For more information on travel funding, please see the IISSO Funding Page. There is also preliminary information on the Thesis/Dissertation funding on the Funding page. You may also contact any of the current officers with questions or concerns about membership and eligibility.</p>

<h3 id="_events">Events</h3>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_research_meetings">Research Meetings</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Individual projects and labs schedule weekly meetings in 405 and 407 FIT,
 the IIS main meeting rooms.
Affiliates can book rooms with Renee Cogar.
 These meetings and descriptions are publicly posted to our website,
 and all IIS Affiliates and students are encouraged to drop in or participate
  in ongoing research meetings.
There are approximately 25 regularly scheduled research meetings per week for
externally funded projects.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_cognitive_science_seminar">Cognitive Science Seminar</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Cognitive Science Seminar is a hybrid course/public lecture.
Students who register for the course (COMP/PHIL/PSYC 7514/8514) attend a course-only
portion from 2:20pm to 4pm as well as a guest lecture portion, which is also
open to the public, from 4pm to 5:20pm.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The topic of the seminar varies semester by semester, as do the faculty leading it.
It is common for students to have lunch with guest speakers and for faculty to take them to dinner.
More information about the seminar can be found in the faculty chapter.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_guest_speakers">Guest Speakers</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IIS Affiliates will often host visitors who are willing to give a talk to the
wider IIS community.
Although the IIS does not provide material support for such ad-hoc speakers, we
encourage Affiliates to make use of our meeting rooms and work with IIS staff to
promote the talk.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_speed_date">Speed Date</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the end of each semester (typically 4pm to 7pm the Friday before Study Day),
the IIS holds a Speed Date event in which 8-10 Affiliates give 5-minute
presentations of their current research interests.
The presentation portion is followed by a wine and cheese poster session,
organized by the IISSO, where students present their latest research.
Affiliates who wish to volunteer to speak at the Speed Date are always welcome to do so.
Otherwise, Affiliates are invited based on how much time has passed since their
last presentation, with priority given to Affiliates who recently joined.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_branding">Branding</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Use of IIS logo and branding is encouraged on presentation slides and conference posters. Discretion and care should be taken to avoid using the IIS brand in such a way that it endorses an activity besides an individual&#8217;s research.

<p>The IIS engages in outreach and encourages students and faculty to participate.
These activities help promote the IIS brand, attract future students, and help us connect with new collaborators.
Outreach activities can take place on-campus or off-campus.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On-campus, IIS faculty and students are frequently asked to participate in lab tours and
associated demonstrations. Often touring groups are middle or high school students, so
the tours/demonstrations need to be tailored to a general audience.
These are excellent opportunities for graduate students to practice their presentation skills.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Off-campus events include demonstrations at schools or community events, speaking engagements,
competition judging, and similar activities. Often times off-campus outreach is spearheaded by a

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_cognitive_science_graduate_certificate">Cognitive Science Graduate Certificate</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The certificate is available to all enrolled graduate students from any department.
Additionally, students can be on the certificate as <strong>non-degree-seeking</strong> and by doing so be eligible for GA positions.
Similarly, non-degree-seeking students on the certificate are eligible for financial aid.
So a student between UG and a graduate program may find taking the certificate to be an effective use of their time while they are waiting to be admitted to a graduate program.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ideally, students interested in the certificate will apply for admission right away, but it is also possible to enter the certificate right before graduating and have previous classes retroactively count toward the certificate (as long as no more than 6 hours are "double counted" towards the certificate and another degree).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Students already enrolled in a graduate program (or who have previously been degree-seeking) can apply to enter the certificate by filling out a change of status form:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>and then filling out the form, printing/signing, and mailing to the Graduate School or walking over to the Graduate School.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the student is currently enrolled as non-degree and has never been degree-seeking he or she must complete an online readmit application.</p>

<p>The minor is available to all undergraduate students <strong>except</strong> Psychology majors.
Psychology majors should instead take the Cognitive Science concentration within the Psychology major.</p>

<p>Most staff are available during academic hours and on an as-needed basis. The major exceptions are
grant preparation and software development.</p>

<p>Grant preparation support is negotiated in advance and
coordinated according to other grant submissions that are due at approximately the same time. This
coordination encourages faculty to notify of intent to submit and work with our grant preparation staff
well in advance of the submission deadline.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Software development likewise is time-intensive for any given project.
Currently, software development support is allocated using an RFP system.
Faculty write a 1-2 page narrative describing how their project
would benefit from software development support.
Support is allocated in 2-month blocks per project on a 6-month cycle.
During any 2-month block, our software development staff member is 100%
committed to the assigned project.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The IIS has different support for students than it does for faculty.
The major support structure is the IISSO.
After discussing the IISSO, we will cover some additional topics with a view to
the interdisciplinary issues that sometimes come up and your professional development.
These sections are intended to supplement, rather than replace, the mentoring
you receive from your major professor.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_iisso">IISSO</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IISSO currently makes funding recommendations for student conference travel and thesis/dissertation funding.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The policies guiding these recommendations is constantly in flux, so students are advised to check the following link
for the current policies <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/iissomemphis2/travel-info-1" class="bare">https://sites.google.com/site/iissomemphis2/travel-info-1</a></p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Just as important, the IISSO organizes various social events that contribute to professional development,
guest speaker lunches and the Speed Date poster session.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Guest speaker lunches are an extremely important way for students to get practice talking to unfamiliar colleagues about their research.
This is a scenario that will occur again and again in professional life, particularly on job interviews, and guest speaker lunches provide a friendly, low-risk environment in which to practice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Speed Date poster session is similarly a great opportunity to practice speaking and presentation skills.
Unlike an academic conference, where the audience may be specialists in a particular area, the Speed Date audience is highly diverse.
This creates an opportunity to practice speaking with interested colleagues who are non-specialists, again in a friendly low-risk environment.
Students are encouraged to use posters from recent or upcoming conference presentations rather than creating posters specifically for the Speed Date,
though creating posters specifically for the Speed Date is not discouraged.</p>

<h3 id="_expectations">Expectations</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the trickiest things about doing interdisciplinary work is navigating the
different ideas and workflows from other fields.
Often other fields will do things "a certain way," and <strong>expect</strong> others to do things the same way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a student, it is particularly important to be aware of expectations, the fact that expectations
from faculty other than your major professor may be different, and that they matter.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_hiring_examples">Hiring examples</h4>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_non_computing_faculty_hires_computing_student">Non-computing faculty hires computing student</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A non-computing faculty may have a funded project that requires some programming.
That faculty member may have a strong idea of what needs to be done, and be able
to communicate the design, or they may not.
Similarly, that faculty member may have experience with software development and
understand the time course of development, or they may not.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A computing student who is hired as a graduate assistant to such a faculty member needs
to be very careful.
Why?
Because the expectations of the faculty member and of the student may be far apart.
The faculty member may assume that it will take 3 months to develop the software.
The student may have <strong>no idea</strong> how long it takes to develop but hopes the faculty
member is understanding of any unforeseen challenges and the learning curve.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_computing_faculty_hires_psychology_student">Computing faculty hires psychology student</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A computing faculty may have a project that requires some kind of human experiment for validation.
So the faculty may hire a psychology student to run the experiment.
The faculty member may know something about running experiments, or they may not.
Likewise, they may have experience designing experiments, or they may not.
Again, a psychology student hired as a graduate assistant needs to be very careful because of expectation mismatch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The faculty member may not understand that it can take 1-2 months to get a study approved by IRB
and that the study has to be completely specified in the IRB submission (all materials, etc.).
The faculty member may have unrealistic expectations about how long it will take to
run the study, e.g., an eyetracker study with 100 subjects.
And the psychology student may not really know how long some things will take.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_dealing_with_these_examples">Dealing with these examples</h5>

<p>Different fields have different standards for theses and dissertations.
In some fields, these will be brand new work; in other fields, these will be
existing publications sandwiched with an introduction and conclusion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you ask someone from another field to be on your committee, you are implicitly
agreeing, either partially or in full, to meet the standards of their field.
No professor will be on your committee and let you say/do things that run contrary
to their field.
So, think very carefully about your committee membership, <strong>talk</strong> in advance to potential
committee members to make sure they are agreeable to your plan.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, different fields have different conventions about</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>How defense meetings are conducted (formal/informal, when questions are taken)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Format of the document (e.g., proposal in perfect format vs. draft)</p>

<li>
<p>How far in advance the document is sent to the committee (e.g., 2 weeks or more)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again, it is important to discuss these things with your committee and your major professor.
You should also be very careful about if your department will allow outside members
on your committee.
Most departments require a committee chair in your department, some allow only one
member from another field, and some <strong>require</strong> a member from another field.</p>

Your major professor can help, and resources from the IIS can help.
But they will only help if you actually make use of them.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most faculty will try to prepare you for a university tenure-track.
That&#8217;s the hardest path and doesn&#8217;t necessarily shut you down from other paths.
How hard is the university path?
According to one study, about 20% of PhDs get tenure-track jobs.
You have to work very hard.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s break it down.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_who_has_the_job_you_want">Who has the job you want?</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All academics have their CVs online.
If you want to be a tenure-track professor at Stanford, go to that department
website and look at the people they hired in the last five years.
It&#8217;s important to look at recent hires because hiring criteria change over time.
Look at the appointment date on these CVs and then filter out the publications/accomplishments
that were obtained the year before hire.
Why the year before?
Because academics go on the job market in the fall to land a job <strong>the following August</strong>
Using this process, your goal is defined: to get this person&#8217;s job, you need to
have a CV that was at least as impressive as theirs.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_break_it_down_by_year">Break it down by year</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should now have an idea of what your yearly publication rate should be and what mix (conference/journal/etc).
Perhaps it is two first author publications and two co-authored publications.
How do you plan for this?
It is important to talk to your major professor and come up with a plan.
Saying "I will publish two first author papers this year" is not a plan (it&#8217;s just a re-statement of the goal).
Again, you can work backwards, but you probably will need guidance to do this well.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_break_it_down_by_paper">Break it down by paper</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Conferences have deadlines.
If you know what conference you want to publish in, you can use that date and work backwards.
Journals don&#8217;t have deadlines, but they take a long time.
A year or more might pass between submission and seeing your paper in print.
In either case, you need to plan.
Assuming you already have an idea:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Talk to your advisor to make sure it&#8217;s a good idea</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do a literature review so you really understand how your idea fits in existing research. If this is 30 previous papers, you might read one paper a day for a month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do whatever work it takes to realize and evaluate your idea. Try to get your advisor to help you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write your idea and results up. If you write a page a day, it will take 8-12 days for a conference paper, 15-30 days for a journal article.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Send your draft paper to your coauthors for feedback. Expect 1-2 weeks for feedback and time to merge their comments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you can see, it will take several months to go from idea to submitted publication.
There are a couple of strategies you can use to increase your output.
First, always have something under review.
Since conferences are seasonal, this implies you will be submitting to journals during other parts of the year.
Second, have multiple projects going on at the same time.
If you work with other people, this will naturally happen, because its unlikely
different research projects will be in synchrony.
If you do this, you will have different papers in different stages all the time.
This style of work is common in industry.
In TV, for example, a show will often have one episode in pre-production, one in production, and another in post-production at any given time.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_everything_else">Everything else</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Usually, your future employer will not care about your academic transcript.
Some might, and it is important to consider that.
However, if you spend all your time making straight A&#8217;s in your courses but don&#8217;t
publish well, you are not going to be a successful candidate for a tenure-track job.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the flip side, there is something else that is important for a tenure-track that students
don&#8217;t often think about&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;letters of recommendation.
Of course, your major professor can write you a letter, but you will also need other letters (typically two others).
You should have a long-term plan for cultivating these letters so that they are as good as they can possibly be.
The letter should come from someone who knows your work well, has seen you present,
has published with you or worked closely with you on a project, and <strong>most importantly</strong> is enthusiastic about your work.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes students want to take an online course or more than 9 hours.
If this happens, you should get permission. Otherwise, you may be asked to cover those expenses.
Why?
For departmental GAs, the IIS receives exactly 9 hours of tuition
reimbursement from the university.
If you go over 9 hours, the IIS has to pay from its indirect cost budget,
which is the same budget that funds student travel and other items.
For grant GAs, this is usually less of a problem, but grants like the IIS have a
budget item for tuition that is calculated at 9 hours.
So if you go over, you can actually put the grant into deficit, which the PI of
the grant becomes responsible for.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_some_perspective">Some perspective</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can look at a GA as just your job, or you can look at it as an investment in your career.

However, as an investment in your career, you may choose to work more than 20 hours
to be competitive on the job market post-degree.</p>

<h3 id="_speaking_and_writing">Speaking and Writing</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Speaking and writing are fundamental skills for your professional career.
This can be particularly challenging for non-native speakers, but speaking and
writing are often challenging for native speakers who are not used to the <strong>genre</strong>
of academic presenting and writing.
In other words, you may know how to write, but you don&#8217;t know how to write right!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For students who need a lot of help with the mechanics of writing, the University
offers several specialized resources:</p>

<p>The cornerstone of expertise is <strong>deliberate practice</strong>.
To become an expert academic speaker and writer, you need to carefully think about
what you are doing, how you are doing it, what the alternative ways are, and then practice
the best way.
It helps a lot if you get feedback from others.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How do you get feedback and the opportunity to practice?
Most programs have informal meetings where students present, and many labs
encourage practice talks.
Make use of these opportunities!
It takes <strong>years</strong> of practice to get really good at academic speaking, so keep practicing and study others as they present.
This is particularly important for job talks, which are slightly different than any other talk you will give.</p>

<p>The IIS is primarily geared toward supporting faculty research.
We do that by providing resources and services.
These resources and services are designed to help you do pilot work for grants,
submit grants, lead grants, and wind down grants.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why do we focus so much on grants?
While research does not need to be backed by a grant to be worthwhile,
the IIS is almost entirely funded by grant activity through indirect cost recovery
and salary buyout from its faculty lines.
Without ongoing grant activity, the IIS would have to eliminate many of the resources we currently provide.
Eventually, a lack of grant activity would probably lead to our staff being reassigned to other units.
In other words, grants are an existential concern for the IIS, and we give priority to
activities that support faculty through the grant life cycle.</p>

<h3 id="_establishing_yourself">Establishing yourself</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the end of the day, the IIS is a community of researchers above everything else.
When you are new or trying to move your research in a new direction, how do you
establish yourself?
The IIS provides several community building activities for faculty.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_cognitive_science_seminar_2">Cognitive Science Seminar</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you decide to lead it, the seminar is an excellent venue for giving other faculty a <strong>deep</strong> look at
your research area.
Even if you are just a participant, the seminar is the best way to help with your optics.</p>

<div class="admonitionblock tip">

If you don&#8217;t attend the seminar regularly, people probably won&#8217;t know who you are.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Leading the seminar can be very helpful for new faculty or faculty interested in
pursuing a new research direction.
The seminar lets you engage other IIS Affiliates for an entire semester - it is comparable
to them sitting in a class on your research area for a whole semester.
Because other Affiliates know your area better, your leading the seminar creates
a natural context for collaborative projects and proposals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The seminar traditionally has invited speakers for at least some of the public talks,
and the IIS provides $5000 for these speaker&#8217;s travel, hotel,
and meals.
The speakers can be faculty with whom you&#8217;re already collaborating or would like to
collaborate, so having invited speakers can also advance your research agenda.
Speakers typically have a lunch with students, which presumably includes your students,
and are taken to dinner by faculty, again presumably you and faculty who either
already overlap in terms of research or who you&#8217;d like to recruit into that area.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The seminar is cross-listed with three departments (PSYC/PHIL/COMP) and is a required
course for the CogSci graduate certificate.
Faculty leading the seminar often recruit students from other departments into their labs
by getting to know them in the course.
The format of the course is typically discussion-based, with a final paper/project.
These details can be changed as needed, but it is important to remember that
because the class is cross-listed, assignments need to be suitable for students from different backgrounds.
One way to handle this is to give slightly different options for assignments depending
on how the student registered for the class (i.e., under PSYC vs. under COMP).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, the seminar is very popular with Affiliates and is usually booked a year in advance.
So if you&#8217;re thinking about leading a seminar, talk to the IIS Director, Alistair Windsor, right away.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_speed_date_2">Speed Date</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Speed Date has some of the same advantages for establishing yourself as the
CogSci Seminar but is a much smaller commitment.
It can be useful for getting yourself introduced to the community if you haven&#8217;t had a chance
to lead a CogSci Seminar yet.
Faculty sometimes get a little too focused on their 5-minute presentation;
while that is important, the reception afterward is also important.
The reception will give you a chance to talk to other faculty while your presentation
is fresh on their minds.
Also, if you have students with posters, their presentations to other faculty can
be a great way to get your message out.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_getting_on_projects">Getting on projects</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The IIS has a tradition of being very welcoming to faculty.
If there is an established project that you think you might be interested in, talk to the
faculty leading the project and see if it would make sense to sit in.
By sitting in on a project, you will get to know other faculty&#8217;s research and have
opportunities for collaboration that might lead to publications.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_faculty_resources">Faculty resources</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The IIS provides various resources, but with the exception of staff time and a portion
of our graduate assistantships, availability of these resources need to be confirmed
each year as funds become available.
Unfortunately, it is difficult for the IIS to declare availability by a specific date,
for example, September 1st, because our indirect cost recovery funds are not released to us
predictably.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_graduate_assistantships_2">Graduate assistantships</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The IIS assigns GAs to our faculty lines (which often don&#8217;t receive departmental support: Banerjee, Bidelman, Olney, Pavlik, Rus),
then to IIS grantees whose external grants have ended and need "bridging" support between grants,
and then to the IIS generally.
The IIS has a strong tradition of faculty not abusing this arrangement;
it is relatively common for our faculty lines to release their GA slots back to the
pool when they have grants to support their students.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each year in late spring, assuming that any slots are unfilled, the IIS issues a
request for proposals to all Affiliates for 1-year GAs that start the following fall.
The 1-year GAs are non-renewable, cover up to 9 hours of tuition
(any additional hours must be approved on a case by case basis), and are paid
$1200/month for pre-masters students and $1500/month
for post-masters students.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Faculty proposals should be 1-2 pages in length and include
(1) what the student would work on
(2) how the student is currently funded
(3) how the student&#8217;s efforts will mesh with your own efforts to gain future external support.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Faculty who are not planning to submit are encouraged to volunteer to review the proposals.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_software-development-support">Software development support</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The IIS currently solicits proposals for software developer time on a six-month cycle.
Each cycle consists of two-month assignments to three different projects.
After two months support will shift to the next project, so establishing sustainability/continuity on each project is key.
That means that other personnel should work closely our senior software developer, Andrew Tackett,
so that they can function independently after the two-month assignment ends.
Faculty receiving assignments will be asked to provide feedback on Andrew Tackett&#8217;s
performance for annual evaluation purposes.</p>

<p>It all starts with an idea.
Ideas can come from many places, but at the IIS we have a particular orientation

<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Interdisciplinary research is a mode of research by teams or individuals that integrates information, data, techniques, tools, perspectives, concepts, and/or theories from two or more disciplines or bodies of specialized knowledge to advance fundamental understanding or to solve problems whose solutions are beyond the scope of a single discipline or area of research practice.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How do you have an interdisciplinary idea?
Most likely by working with people from other disciplines, learning about those
disciplines, and making the connection between your discipline and those disciplines.
This should happen naturally as you participate in the IIS community.
A complementary approach is to look for authentic problems in city, county, or
state where you can make both a research contribution and a societal contribution.</p>

<h4 id="_forming_a_team">Forming a team</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You may decide to form a team before the proposal stage or during the proposal
stage.
The advantage of forming a team beforehand (or alternatively working with faculty
  beforehand) is that you will have a better idea of each team members strengths
  and research interests.
If you form a team during the proposal phase, you will have an extra layer of
complexity in figuring out how to organize the team.
This can be particularly complicated if you are working across institutions on
a large project.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_proposal">Proposal</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is very important that you disclose your intent to submit (even if it is tentative)
to Adam Remsen as early as possible and more than a month before
the submission deadline.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is also important to understand that Adam Remsen does not have

Adam Remsen&#8217;s job is to:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Adam Remsen does not submit the final proposal.
When the proposal is finalized, Adam Remsen will notify OSP,
and OSP will add any additional institutional information and submit the proposal.
Therefore it is very important to have the proposal ready before the sponsor&#8217;s
deadline so that Adam Remsen can pass the proposal to OSP in time
for them to do their job.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the most important aspects of the proposal is the budget because it
determines almost everything else.
When you meet with Adam Remsen to prepare the budget, there are
several things to be particularly cognizant of:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Travel</p>

<p>Computers</p>

<p>Staff</p>

<li>
<p>Effort</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_travel">Travel</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some sponsors limit travel, and some do not.
Many sponsors <strong>require</strong> travel to coordinate with the sponsor (e.g., DoD and IES).
Do not handicap your budget by eliminating <strong>necessary</strong> travel!
If your project has dissemination goals, budget travel to advance those goals.
Travel should be calculated based on these goals and the number of personnel on
the project who are advancing these goals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, if students are going to be involved in dissemination, set reasonable
targets for the number of conferences students will present the research at given
their current development (e.g., 1 per year or 2 per year).
Although the IIS will fund student conference travel, it is entirely appropriate
to fund travel directly off the grant when the travel meets project goals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, the University requires separate line items for international and domestic
travel.
Make sure to put some funds into international travel if there is <strong>any</strong> chance
you will need to travel internationally.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_computers_2">Computers</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Computers used to be considered special equipment.
Now they are considered office supplies, meaning they cannot be charged to a grant
<strong>unless</strong> they fulfill a special purpose.
This is called an <strong>unlike circumstance</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any computer that is being used by graduate students for purposes like checking
email, doing classwork, or writing their thesis, cannot be treated as an unlike
circumstance.
An unlike circumstance would be appropriate for a computer driving a piece of
equipment like any eyetracker, a computer only used for experiments, a computer
used for advanced software development, or a server.
Any unlike circumstance computer can be directly charged to the grant.
The IIS will only provide computers for funded projects if they fall into the
category of office supplies.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_students_2">Students</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are <a href="https://bf.memphis.edu/spectrum/hr/eclass.php">many ways to hire students</a> on a grant.
Each of these has its own rules, and it beyond the scope of this document to
discuss all the rules and restrictions that apply to all categories, particularly
those involving different kinds of visa restrictions for international students.
However, some salient issues are briefly noted:</p>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_graduate_assistants">Graduate Assistants</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Graduate assistants (GAs) on contract for a <strong>maximum</strong> of 20 hours a month and
are compensated with some combination of tuition and stipend.
It is recommended that tuition and stipend are matched dollar for dollar, e.g.,
10 hours and half tuition, though flexibility is possible.
Funding agencies typically place no upper limit on stipend amount, so you can
pay your students whatever you think is fair and competitive.
<strong>You will not make your grant more likely to be funded by underpaying your
students.</strong>
Please do not intentionally "split-fund" students across grants and departments.
This creates unnecessary complexity, both in terms of contracts and in terms of
effort reporting.
You are encouraged to fully fund students on grants at a competitive wage.
Finally, 9 hours is considered full enrollment and is required for departmental
GAs and international GAs until they finish their coursework.
However, cost variations from 9 hours can occur: students who are domestic and
choose to take less may cost less, some programs require more than 9 hours, and
some classes/programs have additional fees.
It is important to consider all of these factors when planning the GA portion of
your budget.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_student_employees">Student employees</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Student employees <a href="http://www.memphis.edu/financialaid/pdfs/se_employer_handbook.pdf">must be students enrolled in a minimum number of hours and are
capped at 25 hours per week</a>.
By definition, student employees cannot have another position like a GA.
As a result, it is more common for student employees to be undergraduate students
than graduate students, but it is possible for graduate students also to be
student employees.
From a budgeting perspective, choosing an hourly rate, number of hours, and
number of employees makes calculating these costs fairly straightforward.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_staff_3">Staff</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are more restrictions on grant-funded staff than on students.
Depending on the sponsor, you may not be allowed to hire staff to do a particular
kind of work.
For example, you may not be allowed to hire staff to do clerical work.
As with student employees, it is beyond the scope of this document to discuss
all staff hiring and employment-related issues, but a few are briefly noted.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_temporary_employees">Temporary employees</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Temporary employees are the easiest to hire.
The hiring process does not typically involve a formal search.
However, temps have limited duration employment (less than a year) and do not receive full benefits.
They must work 100% on the grant that funds them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_regular_employees">Regular employees</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regular employees on a grant must go through the same hiring process for any staff
member at the university.
Therefore it may take 2-3 months to complete a hire.
They have no duration (except the lifetime of the grant that pays them) and
receive full benefits.
Importantly their position is tied to the grant and ends when the grant ends.
They must work 100% on the grant that funds them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_limited_positions">Limited positions</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Limited positions do not exist within grants but may be funded by grants.
List regular employees, they must go through a full search process.
Limited positions exist at the department level or above, extend beyond the lifetime
of the grant (as long as there is another funding source), and may be split
across projects.
In theory, limited positions are most appropriate for high-value employees who
are funded by grants and who wish to remain at the university for an extended
period of time.
In practice, however, staff who start in other positions and then go through the
hiring process to obtain a limited position usually do not stay longer than an additional year.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Missing from the above discussion are postdocs, research faculty, and research
scientists.
These are all considered to have faculty status, rather than staff status, and so
follow the normal faculty hiring and employment processes.
These positions may be set up as limited positions or they may not.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_effort">Effort</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For federal compliance, grant personnel (faculty, students, and staff) are required
to report effort.
At the University of Memphis, effort is reported three times a year: fall, spring,
and summer semesters.
Faculty effort will typically be 100% in their department.
When a grant is awarded that has faculty effort during one of the three effort
reporting periods, faculty effort during that period is reallocated from the
department to the grant.
This is one of several reasons why the department chair, as financial manager
of the department, has to approve the grant proposal before submission.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Faculty who are overseeing a funded student during the academic year should have some
effort during the academic year consistent with that supervisory role.
As a general rule, effort should be reported when it is expended.
Some sponsors, e.g., NSF, allow for very little effort on grants, and faculty may
feel pressured to expend/report that effort during the summer.
In such cases, it may be appropriate to request <strong>cost share</strong>, which is a way for
the university to sponsor some of your effort on the project.
It is important to understand that cost share becomes part of your effort, and
you cannot double count cost-shared effort across projects.
Cost share is a somewhat complicated subject, but essentially can be
voluntary/mandatory and committed/uncommitted.
The first factor corresponds to whether it is required in the proposal, and the
second factor corresponds to whether cost share is specified in the proposal/budget
and is therefore contractually binding.
Returning to the NSF example, it may be appropriate for faculty to request a
voluntary uncommitted cost share (which NSF allows) of 10%, which approximately
equals one course.
Such a cost share would then appear on effort certification.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Effort not only has implications for effort reporting but also for faculty
compensation.
The University of Memphis offers some extremely competitive incentive policies.
The first, summer salary, is typically available at research universities.
Through this program, any effort during the summer charged to the grant is paid
out to the faculty member proportional to their 9-month salary.
The second program is called <strong>incentive pay</strong> and applies to the academic year.
During this time period, the faculty member&#8217;s salary could be seen as supported
by the grant, with the university saving the cost.
However, the University of Memphis pays the faculty member&#8217;s salary and gives
the faculty member <strong>up to half</strong> of the grant-charged effort.
Incentive pay requires the chair&#8217;s approval, and the department must be reimbursed
for any grant-incurred costs, like replacement instructors.
When both of these incentive policies are considered, a 9-month faculty member
who is 100% effort on grants will make 1 + 1/3 + 1/2 = 1.83 times their base salary.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another incentive policy indirectly tied to effort is indirect cost recovery.
The University of Memphis has an indirect cost rate (or facilities and administration rate)
negotiated with the federal government, meaning that all federal grants are
charged the same rate for overhead costs like electricity, heat, cleaning, etc.
The University of Memphis redirects these funds to various sources, including
the college, research center, department, and investigators, based on the dollars
spent on the grant in the previous fiscal year.
How is this tied to effort?
When the proposal summary form is created, there is an item for <strong>shared credit</strong>
between faculty on the proposal.
This shared credit will be used to determine future splits of indirect cost
recovery between the units listed above.
Although there is no set policy for determining shared credit, one way that PI&#8217;s
may wish to calculate it is by looking at their effort as a proportion of total
effort on the project.
For example, if a faculty member is contributing 1 month of effort to a proposal
where the total effort by all faculty is 4 months, then that faculty member&#8217;s
shared credit could be estimated as 25%.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_award">Award</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notification of the award will usually be communicated from the sponsor to the
Office of Sponsored Projects.
You may or may not be cc&#8217;d on that initial notification.
Office of Sponsored Projects will process and approve the award and then notify you.
OSP&#8217;s approval will trigger grants accounting to set up one or more accounts
Banner according to your budget.
Your budget will be grants accounting&#8217;s blueprint for setting everything up,
including effort and positions.
Some grants are structured such that you will receive a new award notification each
year.
Similarly, a no-cost extension may be processed with a new award notification.
However, additional years and NCEs usually do not trigger the creation of new
accounts in Banner.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_implementation">Implementation</h4>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_spending_appropriately">Spending appropriately</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jenice Jackson and Mattie Haynes will help you spend
grant funds appropriately.
Typically this means proper allocation of summer salary, academic year incentive,
student contracts, equipment purchases, and travel.
It is important to understand that some costs are <strong>allowable</strong> and some costs are not.
Allowable costs are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Allowed by the sponsor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allocable to the project</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reasonable and prudent costs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consistent costs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conform to university policies and regulations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conform to OMB Circular A-21</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IIS staff and grants accounting will guide you regarding allowable costs.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_purchasing">Purchasing</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are <a href="http://bf.memphis.edu/bfguide/10191.htm">three primary ways of purchasing</a>.
The simplest is the purchasing card held by Renee Cogar.
The P-card can be used for online vendors, like Amazon, if the price is low.
The next easiest is TigerBuy.
Many pre-approved vendors are on TigerBuy and have specialized web portals that
the university can use to buy goods at a pre-approved rate.
Finally, the university has a bidding process for expensive products where there is
not already a vendor agreement in place and the product is not sole-source.
Different purchases will follow different procedures with corresponding timeframes
for completion.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_hiring">Hiring</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hiring GAs tends to be fairly straightforward, with no search required,
and the university has an e-contract system in place to facilitate.
Hiring staff and faculty-equivalent positions, however, requires following
<a href="http://umwa.memphis.edu/umpolicies/UM1495.htm">the university&#8217;s general hiring procedures.</a>
Briefly stated, hiring regular staff requires</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>A position number backed with 1 year&#8217;s salary (or more)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A position posting which must be approved at multiple levels and be publicly
available for two weeks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interviews of candidates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A hiring proposal, which is followed by a background check and various approvals</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A timeline of 1-2 months to complete these steps would be a reasonable expectation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Faculty-equivalent searches are much the same except they have a committee involved
in all decisions, a broader advertisement plan, and a longer posting period.
These additional factors typically add 1-2 months to the process.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_budget_changes">Budget changes</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Changes to the budget are inevitable.
Common reasons for budgetary changes include delays in filling positions,
changing price of equipment, and change in faculty effort.
It is important to note that some changes require the approval of the sponsor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any change to the budget will affect when the project runs out of money.
Therefore the PI should work with IIS staff on a new budget any time a significant
expense adjustment occurs, e.g., a student funded by the project graduates.
Because some funding categories incur indirect costs and some do not, be very
careful when planning to spend funds by moving them across categories.
For example, unspent student funding that is moved to faculty effort would need to
have indirect costs applied.
Failure to remove indirect costs, in this case, would result in overspending.
As always, IIS staff are your best guide.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Very importantly, if personnel effort changes, grants accounting must be notified.
Personnel effort has implications for payroll and effort reporting.
These systems are essentially automatic once they are set up (at the award stage).
Work with IIS staff to make sure effort changes are reported to grants accounting
in time to be reflected in payroll at the start of the semester.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_closing_down">Closing down</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many sponsors allow for a <strong>no-cost extension (NCE)</strong> of the grant.
This is usually a 1-year extension, with no additional funding, in which the PI
can wrap up the project and spend down the remaining funds.
It is sometimes possible to get a second no-cost extension, but these are
typically scrutinized very carefully.
Sponsors usually consider it inappropriate for a PI to plan on a no-cost extension
before the last 3-6 months of the project.
However, towards the end of the project, if project goals have not been fully
advanced, it is wise for the PI to investigate sponsor rules for requesting
an NCE.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the grant is really going to end, it is important to monitor spending closely.
Ideally, all grant funds would be spent on allowable costs.
Unspent funds will not be available after the grant project period ends.
Overspending will not be charged to the sponsor but instead to the PI&#8217;s indirect
cost recovery account and then, if the PI&#8217;s account is exhausted, to the PI&#8217;s department.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is particularly important to plan for grant staff separation.
This only applies to grant staff and not students or base-budget faculty.
Grant staff have benefits, like annual leave, that, if they have not been taking leave,
will get charged to the grant on separation.
Annual leave benefits accrued by limited positions on previous grants can also
be charged to your grant if they are separating from the university.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The current Memorandum of Understanding required by the College of Arts and
Sciences for interdisciplinary hires details how the larger aspects of the
position are defined with relation to the IIS and the tenuring department.
However, the brevity of that document does not leave room for a statement of
principles and the mutual advantages of the interdisciplinary hire.
The principles and mutual advantages are outlined here but are available
in a free-standing document.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_principles">Principles</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The overarching principle of these interdisciplinary positions is that they
will result in a tenured faculty member with whom both the IIS and the tenuring
department are happy. Neither unit should at any time feel that they are "stuck"
 with a faculty member they don’t want. In order to facilitate this outcome,
 it is important for both units to agree throughout the search process and
 throughout the tenuring process.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_search">Search</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The search committee should represent both IIS
and departmental concerns equally well to ensure agreement later on.
Ideally, the committee is chaired by
a member of the department who is also affiliated with IIS.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The committee’s process should hold to the traditions and practices of the
department as much as possible.
What follows is an example of the process
that has previously been used with great success in these searches.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The committee creates the advertisement, advertising plan, and solicits
applications through their social networks.
The IIS pays for advertising costs and does the administrative paperwork
involved in the search (e.g., WorkForUM).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The committee reviews applications, determines acceptability, and rank orders
a list of candidates for interview (usually 3-4) as well as a list of alternates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The committee&#8217;s rank ordering is presented to IIS Faculty who vote to approve
the rank ordering or propose a different ordering to the committee.
A mutually acceptable ordering is presented to departmental faculty who
likewise vote to approve the current rank ordering.
Reorderings/disagreements at this stage are likewise sent back to committee
and may require re-presentation to IIS Faculty.
In order to ensure a smooth process with minimal revisions, it is important that
 the search committee be able to represent the viewpoints of both units accurately;
 this is likely to produce an ordering of candidates that is approved without
 revision by both faculties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the interview process, great care will be taken to ensure that the
traditions and norms of the tenuring department are followed.
This may include specific times for the candidate’s talk and receptions at a
faculty member’s house, or any other tradition.
An additional half day or full day may be required to accommodate IIS-specific interviews.
Costs for interviews are typically borne by the IIS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After interviews, the search committee will rank the candidates.
This ranking will be approved by both units using the process described in (3)
above.
No candidate will be hired who is deemed unacceptable to either the IIS or the
home department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offers and negotiations will be conducted jointly with the IIS Director
and department chair.
The reason is that both heads have resources that may come into play.
Moreover, this creates confidence in the candidate that both heads are
collaborative and enthusiastic about the hire.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_resources_2">Resources</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The IIS is able to provide much in the way of resources for hires,
including startup, lab space, and ongoing GA support.
As the academic unit of record, the IIS is responsible for 100% of the candidate.
This is in contrast to previous interdisciplinary hire arrangements
(see the IIS Strategic Planning Self-Study for a history).
 As a result, the IIS is financially responsible for the hire.
 This means, for example, that the salary for the line is with the IIS,
 as is the responsibility for advance accounts, overspending, and other
 financial matters.
 The IIS has extensive resources for financial and research support and can
 therefore virtually eliminate the administrative burden on the tenuring
 department (with the notable exception of annual evaluation and tenure
   processes outlined in the MOU).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, it is important to consider how department and IIS resource decisions
made at hire will affect the candidate and their presence in each unit.
If the candidate has no presence in the tenuring department (no office or lab
  space), then there are fewer opportunities for the candidate to interact
  with members of their tenuring department, limiting collaboration.
  It is important for the candidate to have equal access to departmental
  graduate admissions pools, serve on or chair thesis/dissertation committees,
  and otherwise have opportunities consistent with a normal faculty member in
  the department.
  The principle is that resource decisions should not undermine the candidate&#8217;s
  chances relative to regular departmental hires.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_tenure">Tenure</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This process is well defined in the existing MOU format
from the College of Arts and Sciences.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_mutual_advantages">Mutual Advantages</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both IIS and tenuring department will benefit from the interdisciplinary hire.
In many ways, the advantages are symmetric, with both units benefiting equally.
We briefly outline these and note specific exceptions.</p>
</div>
<div class="hdlist">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="hdlist1">
Teaching
</td>
<td class="hdlist2">
<p>The historical load of these positions is 1-1 given their research-intensive
nature.
As stated in the MOU, half of the courses are determined by the department
and half by the IIS.
However, it is almost always the case with current hires of this type that the
department benefits from all courses, as the IIS selection nearly always
is a listed course in the department (usually at the graduate level).
It is unclear given SRI how the 1-1 load will be preserved, but in recent
conversations, the Dean is disposed to at least preserve the 1-1 load during
the tenure evaluation period.
Additionally, the hire will serve on thesis/dissertation committees within the
department and mentor graduate students within the department as well as IIS.</p>
</td>

<tr>
<td class="hdlist1">
Research
</td>
<td class="hdlist2">
<p>The research of the hire should be of interest and value to both units.
 Given the research-intensive nature of the position, there is a high
 expectation for externally funded research with the IIS.
 All IIS lines are grant-active and generate IDCR for both the IIS and the
 tenuring department.
 Given the already reduced load, teaching buyouts are not typically encouraged,
 but should the IIS or department support a buyout, salary recovery
 for release (whatever the current percentage is recommended by CAS) will
  be transferred as needed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="hdlist1">
Service
</td>
<td class="hdlist2">
<p>As University citizens, the hire will be called on to serve on University,
IIS, and departmental committees.
Of all the hire’s effort, service is the last to be bought out
(e.g., a 100% externally funded faculty will have bought out service,
  but an 80% funded faculty will not).
  It is important that the IIS Director and department chair jointly negotiate
  service with the hire to prevent full service obligations arising from both
  sides resulting in double service.
  Successful negotiations will ensure that both units receive the benefit
  of the hire’s service effort.</p>
