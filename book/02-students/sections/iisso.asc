=== IISSO

IISSO currently makes funding recommendations for student conference travel and thesis/dissertation funding.

The policies guiding these recommendations is constantly in flux, so students are advised to check the following link
for the current policies https://sites.google.com/site/iissomemphis2/travel-info-1

**Students who don't follow the policies either receive no funding or greatly reduced funding.**

Just as important, the IISSO organizes various social events that contribute to professional development,
guest speaker lunches and the Speed Date poster session.

Guest speaker lunches are an extremely important way for students to get practice talking to unfamiliar colleagues about their research.
This is a scenario that will occur again and again in professional life, particularly on job interviews, and guest speaker lunches provide a friendly, low-risk environment in which to practice.

The Speed Date poster session is similarly a great opportunity to practice speaking and presentation skills.
Unlike an academic conference, where the audience may be specialists in a particular area, the Speed Date audience is highly diverse.
This creates an opportunity to practice speaking with interested colleagues who are non-specialists, again in a friendly low-risk environment.
Students are encouraged to use posters from recent or upcoming conference presentations rather than creating posters specifically for the Speed Date,
though creating posters specifically for the Speed Date is not discouraged.
