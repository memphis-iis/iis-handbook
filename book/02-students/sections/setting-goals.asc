=== Setting goals

In the end, your degree and your professional career are up to you.
You need to figure out your goals and how to best achieve them.
Your major professor can help, and resources from the IIS can help.
But they will only help if you actually make use of them.

One way to approach goal setting is to work backwards.

==== What job are you preparing for?

It is important to recognize that you are preparing, now, for a future job.
You want to be the *successful applicant* for that job, meaning you are
selected over all other applicants.
How will you achieve that in a competitive world?

TIP: Start preparing for your future job today

Jobs are specialized. You will want to prepare slightly differently for different kinds of jobs.
Here are some examples:

*University Tenure-Track*:: Publishing is key; teaching is mostly irrelevant
*College Tenure-Track*:: Teaching experience is important; publishing less important than university
*Industry Research*:: Publishing less important than university; technical skills important; internships useful
*Industry*:: Technical skills important; internship experience becomes important

Most faculty will try to prepare you for a university tenure-track.
That's the hardest path and doesn't necessarily shut you down from other paths.
How hard is the university path?
According to one study, about 20% of PhDs get tenure-track jobs.
You have to work very hard.

Let's break it down.

===== Who has the job you want?

All academics have their CVs online.
If you want to be a tenure-track professor at Stanford, go to that department
website and look at the people they hired in the last five years.
It's important to look at recent hires because hiring criteria change over time.
Look at the appointment date on these CVs and then filter out the publications/accomplishments
that were obtained the year before hire.
Why the year before?
Because academics go on the job market in the fall to land a job *the following August*
Using this process, your goal is defined: to get this person's job, you need to
have a CV that was at least as impressive as theirs.

===== Break it down by year

You should now have an idea of what your yearly publication rate should be and what mix (conference/journal/etc).
Perhaps it is two first author publications and two co-authored publications.
How do you plan for this?
It is important to talk to your major professor and come up with a plan.
Saying "I will publish two first author papers this year" is not a plan (it's just a re-statement of the goal).
Again, you can work backwards, but you probably will need guidance to do this well.

===== Break it down by paper

Conferences have deadlines.
If you know what conference you want to publish in, you can use that date and work backwards.
Journals don't have deadlines, but they take a long time.
A year or more might pass between submission and seeing your paper in print.
In either case, you need to plan.
Assuming you already have an idea:

- Talk to your advisor to make sure it's a good idea
- Do a literature review so you really understand how your idea fits in existing research. If this is 30 previous papers, you might read one paper a day for a month.
- Do whatever work it takes to realize and evaluate your idea. Try to get your advisor to help you.
- Write your idea and results up. If you write a page a day, it will take 8-12 days for a conference paper, 15-30 days for a journal article.
- Send your draft paper to your coauthors for feedback. Expect 1-2 weeks for feedback and time to merge their comments.

As you can see, it will take several months to go from idea to submitted publication.
There are a couple of strategies you can use to increase your output.
First, always have something under review.
Since conferences are seasonal, this implies you will be submitting to journals during other parts of the year.
Second, have multiple projects going on at the same time.
If you work with other people, this will naturally happen, because its unlikely
different research projects will be in synchrony.
If you do this, you will have different papers in different stages all the time.
This style of work is common in industry.
In TV, for example, a show will often have one episode in pre-production, one in production, and another in post-production at any given time.

==== Everything else

Usually, your future employer will not care about your academic transcript.
Some might, and it is important to consider that.
However, if you spend all your time making straight A's in your courses but don't
publish well, you are not going to be a successful candidate for a tenure-track job.

On the flip side, there is something else that is important for a tenure-track that students
don't often think about -- letters of recommendation.
Of course, your major professor can write you a letter, but you will also need other letters (typically two others).
You should have a long-term plan for cultivating these letters so that they are as good as they can possibly be.
The letter should come from someone who knows your work well, has seen you present,
has published with you or worked closely with you on a project, and *most importantly* is enthusiastic about your work.
