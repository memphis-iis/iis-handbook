=== Graduate Assistantships

Students cannot request assistantships directly.
Graduate assistantships (GAs) are supported by grants, your home department, and in
some cases, the IIS.

==== Rules
See the http://www.memphis.edu/gradschool/current_students/ga.php[Graduate School website]
for current rules; but generally

- GAs are "on contract" to work 20 hours a week
- GAs receive both stipend and tuition
- GAs must maintain a 3.0 grade point average

IMPORTANT: Read your GA contract carefully!

Departmental GAs and grant GAs have the following important difference

- Deparmental GAs must take a full load ({ga-tuition-hours} hours) until they start their thesis/dissertation
- Grant GAs can take less than a full load as long as they have student status

==== Continued employment

Before the end of each semester, you need to

- Ask the faculty member you report to if you will be funded next semester
- Talk to {financial-services-associate} about your contract

==== Extra tuition expenses

Sometimes students want to take an online course or more than {ga-tuition-hours} hours.
If this happens, you should get permission, otherwise you may be asked to cover those expenses.
Why?
For departmental GAs, the IIS receives exactly {ga-tuition-hours} hours of tuition
reimbursement from the university.
If you go over {ga-tuition-hours} hours, the IIS has to pay from its indirect cost budget,
which is the same budget that funds student travel and other items.
For grant GAs, this is usually less of a problem, but grants like the IIS have a
budget item for tuition that is calculated at {ga-tuition-hours} hours.
So if you go over, you can actually put the grant into deficit, which the PI of
the grant becomes responsible for.

==== Some perspective

You can look at a GA as just your job, or you can look at it as an investment in your career.
As a job, why would you work more than 20 hours if you weren't paid to?
However, as an investment in your career, you may choose to work more than 20 hours
to be competitive on the job market post-degree.
