=== Expectations

One of the trickiest things about doing interdisciplinary work is navigating the
different ideas and workflows from other fields.
Often other fields will do things "a certain way," and *expect* others to do things the same way.

As a student, it is particularly important to be aware of expectations, the fact that expectations
from faculty other than your major professor may be different, and that they matter.

==== Hiring examples

===== Non-computing faculty hires computing student

A non-computing faculty may have a funded project that requires some programming.
That faculty member may have a strong idea of what needs to be done, and be able
to communicate the design, or they may not.
Similarly, that faculty member may have experience with software development and
understand the time course of development, or they may not.

A computing student who is hired as a graduate assistant to such a faculty member needs
to be very careful.
Why?
Because the expectations of the faculty member and of the student may be far apart.
The faculty member may assume that it will take 3 months to develop the software.
The student may have *no idea* how long it takes to develop, but hopes the faculty
member is understanding of any unforeseen challenges and the learning curve.

===== Computing faculty hires psychology student

A computing faculty may have a project that requires some kind of human experiment for validation.
So the faculty may hire a psychology student to run the experiment.
The faculty member may know something about running experiments, or they may not.
Likewise, they may have experience designing experiments, or they may not.
Again, a psychology student hired as a graduate assistant needs to be very careful because of expectation mismatch.

The faculty member may not understand that it can take 1-2 months to get a study approved by IRB
and that the study has to be completely specified in the IRB submission (all materials, etc).
The faculty member may have unrealistic expectations about how long it will take to
run the study, e.g. an eyetracker study with 100 subjects.
And the psychology student may not really know how long some things will take.

===== Dealing with these examples

How can we make these situations better?
Ideally both sides need to learn a little about the other.
However, that can't happen without communication.

TIP: When doing interdisciplinary work, communicate twice as much (both as often and in length) as you would with someone in your field.

Otherwise, two really bad things can happen

- The faculty member thinks things are done when they aren't
- The faculty member thinks you aren't working when you are

==== Thesis/dissertation expectations

Different fields have different standards for theses and dissertations.
In some fields, these will be brand new work; in other fields, these will be
existing publications sandwiched with an introduction and conclusion.

When you ask someone from another field to be on your committee, you are implicitly
agreeing to, either partially or in full, meet the standards of their field.
No professor will be on your committee and let you say/do things that run contrary
to their field.
So, think very carefully about your committee membership, *talk* in advance to potential
committee members to make sure they are agreeable to your plan.

Additionally, different fields have different conventions about

- How defense meetings are conducted (formal/informal, when questions are taken)
- Format of the document (e.g proposal in perfect format vs. draft)
- How far in advance the document is sent to the committee (e.g. 2 weeks or more)

Again, it is important to discuss these things with your committee and your major professor.
You should also be very careful about if your department will allow outside members
on your committee.
Most departments require a committee chair in your department, some allow only one
member from another field, some *require* a member from another field.

==== Baseline expectations

In addition to the above, there are baseline expectations for all graduate students.
These are things that all faculty members expect, regardless of discipline.

[horizontal]
*Communication*:: Emails returned in under a day
*Deadlines*:: Should never be missed
*Work*:: Documented such that if you were never seen again, *someone
could pick up where you left off ten years from now* and understand what you did
*Attendance*:: *Posted the hours you will be at your desk* ; Don't skip meetings; let people know *in advance* when you are sick
*Initiative*:: Work independently; suggest ideas to problems;
participate in meetings (that means speaking)
*Website/CV*:: Up to date with your status and accomplishments
*Writing*:: Grammatical; organized; proper lit review
*Reading*:: Familiarity with literature in your area
