== Students

This chapter is dedicated to students.
It assumes you've already read the <<_getting_started,Getting Started>> chapter.
If you have not read that, go back and read it now!

The IIS has different support for students than it does for faculty.
The major support structure is the IISSO.
After discussing the IISSO, we will cover some additional topics with a view to
the interdisciplinary issues that sometimes come up and your professional development.
These sections are intended to supplement, rather than replace, the mentoring
you receive from your major professor.
