== Preface by Andrew Olney

Welcome to the first version of the IIS Handbook and Operations Manual.
The IIS has never had a book like this before, but as the IIS has grown in scope and complexity,
so has the need for a handbook that documents our programs and procedures.

This first version (17.05 in year/month notation) reflects my personal views that
have developed over the last 10 years as I've served as Associate Director and
eventually Director of the IIS.
Accordingly, the priorities and biases are mine and have not been endorsed by
the IIS community.

My hope is that future versions will be voted into adoption or follow some
similar consensus-building process.
By hosting this handbook on GitHub and using AsciiDoc, I've made it as easy as
I know how for this book to be improved by a distributed group of people,
potentially across many years, such that all revisions are well documented.
This approach is well-traveled by other open source books,
and I've leaned heavily on the model provided by *Pro Git* (2nd edition).
To make changes, please refer to the procedures in the README file in the root
of this repository.
