=== Cyclical procedures

Many IIS activities and procedures are tied to the academic calendar.

==== Semester Start Activities

===== Email lists

{email-lists} should consult the IIS web site and {director} to see if any Affiliates
need to be added or removed from the email lists.
Additionally, any changes in chairs and deans of Affiliates, as well as higher administration
contacts, should be reflected in the email lists.
Affiliates should be contacted to see if they have any additional students to add
to the mailing lists.
Coordinators for the undergraduate and graduate programs
({iis-undergraduate-coordinator}/{iis-graduate-coordinator}) should be contacted
to see what students are currently enrolled in IIS programs so their names can
also be added to the email lists.

===== Room scheduling

{book-rooms} should contact all Affiliates before the start of the semester to
inquire if they need meeting space.
Affiliates with existing scheduled meetings should be given priority for the times
they have previously scheduled.
The new meetings should be posted on the Google Calendar that displays on the wall
projector outside 405 as well as the IIS website.

===== Keys

{keys} should contact Affiliates to see if they or their students need keys or
electronic access permissions.

===== IISSO

{director} should meet with the president of IISSO to ensure that proper
leadership is in place for the IISSO to handle student travel and thesis awards,
Speed Date poster session, and lunches with CogSci seminar speakers.
{director} should communicate how much funding is available for various programs.
This is an excellent opportunity to reflect with the IISSO about what works
well and what could be done better.

===== Student Travel and Thesis Awards

{financial-services-associate} should email Affiliates and ask them to confirm
student eligibility for travel and thesis awards.
Eligibility information should then be shared with IISSO
IISSO is responsible for managing these programs and should notify
{financial-services-associate} of their funding decisions.
In the case of thesis awards, the IISSO should forward the relevant completed
forms so that {financial-services-associate}  can
 ensure that the thesis advisor has certified the student has
successfully defended their proposal and obtained any needed IRB approval.

===== Speed Date

{speed-date-reservation} should book a room for the Speed Date early because the best space
(Lower Atrium of the Fogelman Executive Center) is often booked in advance.
The IIS has been holding the Speed Date on the Thursday before exams/study day
for the past several years.

{speed-date-invitation} should contact Affiliates to speak at the Speed Date for
the semester.
Since the talks are 5 minutes with 1 minute transitions, there are 9-10 slots to
be filled.


===== Cognitive Science Seminar

====== Travel

{cogsci-travel} should work with faculty leading **next semester's** seminar to
make travel and hotel arrangements for their invited speakers.

====== Communication

{cogsci-communication} should obtain a speaker schedule or syllabus from the
faculty leading the current seminar and distribute on email lists.
The schedule or syllabus should also be sent to {iis-website} to put on the
IIS website and to *This Week* who will post the talks each week in their
newsletter.

====== Recruiting Faculty Leaders

{director} should recruit faculty leaders for future seminars.
It is best for the seminar to be booked out a year in advance as many
departments need that much lead time to handle instructor changes for courses
that faculty leaders might have otherwise taught.

===== Graduate Assistant Contracts

{ga-contract} should contact all Affiliates and ask if there are students
they wish to place on contract for the semester or previous students who they
do not wish to continue for the semester.

===== Grant submissions

{pre-award-coordinator} should email all Affiliates with an introduction of
services provided and an invitation to set up a meeting to discuss grant
opportunities.

===== Degree Programs

Coordinators for the undergraduate and graduate programs
({iis-undergraduate-coordinator}/{iis-graduate-coordinator}) should email
all Affiliates and students regarding how students may enter, advise, and
complete these degree programs.

===== Communication

{iis-website} should check the IIS website for any outdated or missing
information, particularly with regard to Affiliates.

{brochure-designer} should similarly check the IIS brochure and ensure that
sufficient copies are on hand for the needs of the semester.

{social-media} should check that IIS Affiliates are aware of social media
capabilities.
Students who are graduating should be invited to join the IIS LinkedIn group
for tracking and fundraising purposes.

===== Software Development Assignments

{director} should email faculty for proposals for {software-developer}'s
assignments for the six months starting in January (RFP in fall) or July (RFP
  in spring).

==== Spring Semester Additional Activities

===== Student recruiting funds

{director} should email all Affiliates notifying them of student recruiting
funds for bringing prospective students to campus.
The criteria are :

- The student must be in the top 10% of the department's pool (by some objective measure) or be from an underrepresented group.
- Each Affiliate can recruit one student per year with this mechanism.
- The amount of funding the IIS provides is based on the number of IIS Affiliates who are going to meet with this student.

Previous funding limits have been $200 * the number of IIS Affiliates meeting with the student up to the total costs of the visit.

===== Faculty Evaluations

{director} should email all IIS faculty lines and postdocs requesting they
evaluate the director.
Following this evaluation period, {director} should send a follow up email
requesting they update their provost CV and turn in their annual planning
narrative (or equivalent).
When these are obtained, {director} will complete faculty evaluations.
For tenure track lines with tenure housed in other departments, the evaluation
should consist of a letter/memo sent to the chair of the tenuring department
with the dean of that department cc'd.
For IIS lines with no external tenure home, evaluations should be conducted using
the university's electronic system.

===== Staff Evaluations

{director} should complete non-exempt staff performance appraisals by 2/28 and
exempt staff appraisals by 3/31.
Currently {software-developer}'s appraisal is partially based on input from the
faculty from {software-developer}'s assignments.
Ideally that input will be documented in email by the faculty involved shortly
after {software-developer}'s assignment ends.

===== Inventory

{inventory} should conduct an inventory of all IIS equipment.
The equipment should either be on the 4th floor of the FIT, in the server room
of the main library, in departmental server rooms (e.g. Psychology), or off
campus.
It is recommended that all laptops and tablets be covered with an off campus
form.

===== Annual Report

{director} should complete the IIS Annual Report by the end of May using the
following information:

- Financial information provided by {business-officer}
- IIS GA assignment funding provided by {financial-services-associate}
- Student travel award and student speed date presentation provided by IISSO
- Grant award activity provided by OSP
- Publication/citation information provided by Google Scholar through Publish
or Perish

All other information (awards, media attention, outreach) should be tracked by
{director} throughout the year.
The report should be distributed to Affiliates and administrators.

===== Graduate Assistant Request for Proposals

{director} should contact Affiliates to see if student bridging support is needed.
Faculty requests should be verified by {business-officer}.
An RFP should be circulated for remaining slots,
 or slots created to spend down budget surpluses, by May 1.
The RFP should allow faculty at least two weeks to respond with a 1-2 page
proposal.
Proposals should include:

- What the student would work on
- How the student is currently funded
- How the student's efforts will mesh with faculty own efforts to gain future external support

Ideally proposals are reviewed by Affiliates who are not proposing based on:

- Clarity of technical plan
- Intellectual merit
- Potential for future funding
- Enhancing collaboration between Affiliates

Affiliates should be notified of funding decisions by end of May.

==== Monthly Activities

===== Grant Budget Reports

{business-officer} should prepare monthly budget reports to
