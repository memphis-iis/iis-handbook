=== Event-Triggered Procedures

==== Grant Submission

Upon notification by faculty of their intent to submit, {pre-award-coordinator}
will begin a Proposal Summary Form for routing and the associated budget.
{pre-award-coordinator} will explain the process to the faculty and document a
timeline for what documents are needed when, and what documents are bottlenecks
for processes proceeding, e.g., a budget for the PSF.
{pre-award-coordinator} should begin collecting non-narrative documents immediately,
such as biosketches, letters of support, facilities documents, data management plans,
or similar documents required by the sponsor.
All documents should be kept in a cloud-storage accessible folder (e.g., Google Drive)
with all non-current versions of documents stored in a "previous-versions"
subfolder.
The cloud-storage folder should contain a spreadsheet that details
the timeline and status for each required document.
Both {pre-award-coordinator} and the faculty will subscribe to notification
changes to this document if possible (e.g., Google Sheets).
Finally, {pre-award-coordinator} should set a calendar reminder to notify the
faculty each week of various document status, what is needed to make progress,
and any obstacles.

==== New Grant Award

{business-officer} should meet with the faculty to go over the new account,
establish any plans for hiring personnel, and confirm that no deviations from the
original budget need to take place from the outset.

{financial-services-associate} should contact the faculty to see if any student
contracts need to be issued under the new award.

{director} should confirm that the faculty has adequate space and computer equipment
for the project.
If new space access is needed and approved, {keys} should contact the faculty
member to see what keys or electronic access are needed for project personnel.
If the faculty is eligible for a laptop under the Laptop for PIs program, they
should be offered a laptop with any purchase being handled by
{financial-services-associate}.

==== Advance Account

From the perspective that advance accounts are loans guaranteed by departments,
the IIS should exercise discretion in whether to guarantee an advance account.
Requests should be approved by {director} based on the proposed spending plan
and sponsor reliability.
Once an advance account is approved, {advance-account} will prepare the advance
account paperwork under the direction of {business-officer} .

==== Final Year of Grant Award

{business-officer} should meet with the faculty to go over their spending plan
for the final year, to ensure that every dollar is spent appropriately without
overages.
The spending plan should be documented in a contractual fashion with the
faculty member agreeing to abide by the spending plan and to contact
{business-officer} immediately if any deviations from the spending plan occur.

==== No-Cost Extension

Preparation of no-cost extension should be collaborative between the PI,
{business-officer}, and {pre-award-coordinator}.
{business-officer}'s primary role is to account for expenditures and perform
any necessary budget projections.
Using this information, {pre-award-coordinator} together with the PI will
assemble the documentation required by the sponsor.

==== Funding Terminated

Affiliates who have previously been granted IIS space under sponsored research
typically receive a 1-2 year grace period when funding lapses.

In the first year of the lapse, {director} should contact the Affiliate to let
them know that they have been given a grace period and to expect to vacate the
space if funding is not reestablished.

==== New IIS Affiliate

{director} should discuss affiliation,
handle signature of the affiliation agreement,
send the Affiliate a link to the IIS handbook,
and notify IIS staff of the new Affiliate.

{email-lists} should add the Affiliate to the faculty list and inquire if the
new Affiliate has any students to add to the student list.

{iis-website} should add the Affiliate to the IIS web site.

==== Affiliate Recognition

When an Affiliate's work is recognized, whether internally or externally,
{director} should ensure that the recognition is communicated throughout the
IIS and the University:

- {director} announces the recognition on the IIS mailing lists
- {social-media} announces the recognition on social media
- {director} contacts {press-release} if a press release is warranted

==== Outreach/Tour/Demo Requests

{director} should determine how to respond to outreach/tour/demo requests.
Typically these are restricted to the 4th floor of the FIT, but all Affiliates
should be given a chance to participate if they desire.
Outreach/tour/demos should be appropriately branded to enhance the image of the
IIS in the community.

==== Counteroffers

Typically the administrative unit of record is involved in counteroffers, i.e.,
the IIS would only be involved for its faculty lines.
However, from time to time, other departments engage the IIS for assistance in
retaining faculty or recruiting.
{director} should determine how to respond best to advance the interests of the
IIS.

==== Hiring

===== Grant Staff

Grant staff hiring should be performed by the PI on the project, facilitated and
guided by {business-officer}.

===== IIS Staff

{director} should work closely with {business-officer} to define or modify the
position description and complete necessary HR actions.

Position interviews are typically conducted one on one with the Director and
either one on one or in a group with the staff, as appropriate.

Some positions require specialized technical skills that the Director may wish
to evaluate, as approved by HR.

===== Faculty

The current Memorandum of Understanding required by the College of Arts and
Sciences for interdisciplinary hires details how the larger aspects of the
position are defined with relation to the IIS and the tenuring department.
However, the brevity of that document does not leave room for a statement of
principles and the mutual advantages of the interdisciplinary hire.
The principles and mutual advantages are outlined here but are available
in a free-standing document.

====== Principles
The overarching principle of these interdisciplinary positions is that they
will result in a tenured faculty member with whom both the IIS and the tenuring
department are happy. Neither unit should at any time feel that they are "stuck"
 with a faculty member they don’t want. In order to facilitate this outcome,
 it is important for both units to agree throughout the search process and
 throughout the tenuring process.

====== Search
The search committee should represent both IIS
and departmental concerns equally well to ensure agreement later on.
Ideally, the committee is chaired by
a member of the department who is also affiliated with IIS.

The committee’s process should hold to the traditions and practices of the
department as much as possible.
What follows is an example of the process
that has previously been used with great success in these searches.

. The committee creates the advertisement, advertising plan, and solicits
applications through their social networks.
The IIS pays for advertising costs and does the administrative paperwork
involved in the search (e.g., WorkForUM).

. The committee reviews applications, determines acceptability, and rank orders
 a list of candidates for interview (usually 3-4) as well as a list of alternates.

. The committee's rank ordering is presented to IIS Faculty who vote to approve
the rank ordering or propose a different ordering to the committee.
A mutually acceptable ordering is presented to departmental faculty who
likewise vote to approve the current rank ordering.
Reorderings/disagreements at this stage are likewise sent back to committee
and may require re-presentation to IIS Faculty.
In order to ensure a smooth process with minimal revisions, it is important that
 the search committee be able to represent the viewpoints of both units accurately;
 this is likely to produce an ordering of candidates that is approved without
 revision by both faculties.

. During the interview process, great care will be taken to ensure that the
traditions and norms of the tenuring department are followed.
This may include specific times for the candidate’s talk and receptions at a
faculty member’s house, or any other tradition.
An additional half day or full day may be required to accommodate IIS-specific interviews.
Costs for interviews are typically borne by the IIS.

. After interviews, the search committee will rank the candidates.
This ranking will be approved by both units using the process described in (3)
above.
No candidate will be hired who is deemed unacceptable to either the IIS or the
home department.

. Offers and negotiations will be conducted jointly with the IIS Director
and department chair.
The reason is that both heads have resources that may come into play.
Moreover, this creates confidence in the candidate that both heads are
collaborative and enthusiastic about the hire.

====== Resources
The IIS is able to provide much in the way of resources for hires,
including startup, lab space, and ongoing GA support.
As the academic unit of record, the IIS is responsible for 100% of the candidate.
This is in contrast to previous interdisciplinary hire arrangements
(see the IIS Strategic Planning Self-Study for a history).
 As a result, the IIS is financially responsible for the hire.
 This means, for example, that the salary for the line is with the IIS,
 as is the responsibility for advance accounts, overspending, and other
 financial matters.
 The IIS has extensive resources for financial and research support and can
 therefore virtually eliminate the administrative burden on the tenuring
 department (with the notable exception of annual evaluation and tenure
   processes outlined in the MOU).

However, it is important to consider how department and IIS resource decisions
made at hire will affect the candidate and their presence in each unit.
If the candidate has no presence in the tenuring department (no office or lab
  space), then there are fewer opportunities for the candidate to interact
  with members of their tenuring department, limiting collaboration.
  It is important for the candidate to have equal access to departmental
  graduate admissions pools, serve on or chair thesis/dissertation committees,
  and otherwise have opportunities consistent with a normal faculty member in
  the department.
  The principle is that resource decisions should not undermine the candidate's
  chances relative to regular departmental hires.

====== Tenure
This process is well defined in the existing MOU format
from the College of Arts and Sciences.

====== Mutual Advantages
Both IIS and tenuring department will benefit from the interdisciplinary hire.
In many ways, the advantages are symmetric, with both units benefiting equally.
We briefly outline these and note specific exceptions.

[horizontal]
Teaching:: The historical load of these positions is 1-1 given their research-intensive
nature.
As stated in the MOU, half of the courses are determined by the department
and half by the IIS.
However, it is almost always the case with current hires of this type that the
department benefits from all courses, as the IIS selection nearly always
is a listed course in the department (usually at the graduate level).
It is unclear given SRI how the 1-1 load will be preserved, but in recent
conversations, the Dean is disposed to at least preserve the 1-1 load during
the tenure evaluation period.
Additionally, the hire will serve on thesis/dissertation committees within the
department and mentor graduate students within the department as well as IIS.

Research::
The research of the hire should be of interest and value to both units.
 Given the research-intensive nature of the position, there is a high
 expectation for externally funded research with the IIS.
 All IIS lines are grant-active and generate IDCR for both the IIS and the
 tenuring department.
 Given the already reduced load, teaching buyouts are not typically encouraged,
 but should the IIS or department support a buyout, salary recovery
 for release (whatever the current percentage is recommended by CAS) will
  be transferred as needed.

Service::
As University citizens, the hire will be called on to serve on University,
IIS, and departmental committees.
Of all the hire’s effort, service is the last to be bought out
(e.g., a 100% externally funded faculty will have bought out service,
  but an 80% funded faculty will not).
  It is important that the IIS Director and department chair jointly negotiate
  service with the hire to prevent full service obligations arising from both
  sides resulting in double service.
  Successful negotiations will ensure that both units receive the benefit
  of the hire’s service effort.

==== Mid-Tenure and Tenure

This process is well defined in the existing MOU format from the College of
Arts and Sciences.
The specific MOU for the faculty in question should be consulted.
However, the general procedures follow.
In both cases, {director} convenes an IIS committee of tenured faculty and
appoints a committee chair.

===== Mid-Tenure

Mid-tenure review will be conducted by the tenuring unit.
The Institute will contribute a separate statement to be included in
the mid-tenure dossier written by the IIS Director,
as well as a letter from a committee of at least three senior IIS members.

===== Tenure

Tenure and promotion review will be conducted by the tenuring unit.
The Institute will contribute a separate statement to be included in the
tenure and promotion dossier, written by the IIS Director, as well as a
letter from a committee of at least three senior IIS members.
