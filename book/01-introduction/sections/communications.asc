=== Communications

==== Email

The IIS maintains multiple mailing lists:

- IIS-Faculty: faculty affiliates.
- IIS-Students: *interested* students, some of which might not be working with IIS affiliates.
- IIS-Pro: grant-supported staff and postdocs
- IIS-Admin: president, provost, vice president of research, FIT administration, deans and chairs of all faculty affiliates, staff in communications

==== Web

The IIS website has the following elements:

- List of affiliates and staff
- Degree programs
- Calendar of research meetings
- Links to resources
- List of affiliate projects

The IIS Student Organization (IISSO) has their own website with specific information for students.

==== Social Media

Currently the IIS participates in:

- LinkedIn : there is a LinkedIn group for current and former students, staff, and faculty.

- Facebook

IIS social media accounts are managed by  {social-media}.

==== Press Releases

In the past, faculty and students were largely on their own with respect to press releases, meaning that they had to write them, submit them to communications, and then wait and see if anything came of it.

The current process is that {press-release} is on the IIS-Admin list and will proactively create press releases. If faculty or students have a particular story they think is worthy of a press release, they are encouraged to contact {press-release} directly.

==== Branding

Use of IIS logo and branding is encouraged on presentation slides and conference posters. Discretion and care should be taken to avoid using the IIS brand in such a way that it endorses an activity besides an individual's research. Sponsorships and similar promotion/endorsements must be approved by the IIS Director.

Logo art is available on the IIS website under Resources.

==== Signage

The IIS has several signs used primarily for IIS events like the Speed Date. These signs can be used for other purposes but need approval (like branding) and can be checked out from {checkout}.

==== Brochures

General brochures about the IIS are available. While the IIS can provide these in limited quantities (e.g. 100), it should be recognized that these are produced at cost and should be used strategically (e.g. to attract students). General brochures can be obtained from {checkout}.

IIS can also assist faculty affiliates with the creation of brochures specific to their lab or grant project. Faculty wishing to create custom brochures should contact {brochure-designer}.
