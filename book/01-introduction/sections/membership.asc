=== IIS Membership

For many years the IIS did not have a formal membership definition
footnote:[Stan Franklin had a retrospective method that calculated membership
based on participation over a period of time.
However this did not allow on to "sign up," which is a common attribute of memberships.].

Since 2008, the IIS has had a membership letter mechanism: faculty can join the
IIS as "IIS Affiliates" by signing the letter and returning it to the IIS Director.
The letter states what the Affiliate can expect from the IIS and vice versa.
In a nutshell, the IIS expects participation and, ultimately, grant activity that
funds IIS services.
In return the Affiliate has access to the various resources the IIS provides.

There is not a similar membership letter for students.
Students may join the IISSO according to the current policies and procedures of
that organization.
However, being a member of the IISSO does not automatically grant access to IIS
resources.
To access IIS resources, students must be "claimed" by an IIS Affiliate faculty
member as described later in this handbook.
