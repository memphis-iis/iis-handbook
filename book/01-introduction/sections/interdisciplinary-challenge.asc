=== Challenge of Interdisciplinary Research

Interdisciplinary research is hard.
To be successful, we have to step outside our disciplinary perspectives and be willing to learn and to be challenged.
This means not only learning about other disciplines, which have their own literature, methods, and approach to knowledge,
but also learning to work on teams with members of other disciplines.
These issues can impact student milestones and professional development, as well as tenure and career advancement for faculty.
Within a university that has traditional departments, interdisciplinary research can challenge typical departmental procedures from both an
academic (e.g. committee composition) and finance (e.g. course buyout) perspective.

==== Assume Ignorance

The best policy in interdisciplinary research is to assume a limited understanding of other fields.
To paraphrase Bilbo, you don't know half of other fields half as well as you would like;
and you like less than half of other fields half as well as they deserve.
Misunderstandings often arise when researchers use themselves (or members of their field) as a model for researchers in other fields.
The reason this doesn't work is that the differences between fields can be quite profound, well beyond the superficial issue of the area or
object of study.
The differences include:

Knowledge:: What does it mean to "know" something and how can we arrive at "knowing?"
Not all fields are empirical; not all fields use quantitative research methods.

Language:: Each field has its own vocabulary and style of discourse that expresses "knowing."
The same word or phrase may have different meanings across fields,
e.g. "deep learning" means neural networks to computer science, but "deep learning" means durable, semantically interconnected memory to a psychologist.

Scholarly products:: What scholarly products does a "successful" researcher produce, and how often?
Some fields give great weight to books; some fields give great weight to conference proceedings.

Student training:: How are students trained in the field? What kind of mentoring is expected, and what experiences are students expected to have?
Some fields may expect hundreds or thousands of hours of clinical practice or bench work.


==== Communicate the Obvious

Perhaps the biggest problem facing interdisciplinary teams is that communication on these issues either doesn't happen, or happens late in the project.
Therefore it is a good idea to communicate about what, at first, may seem obvious.

For each researcher

- What questions are interesting
- What they can contribute to the project in terms of answering these questions or the questions of others
- How many hours they can **really** contribute per week, including meetings, and any "dead" times during the year where they won't be contributing much
- What they need to do that year to be successful (e.g. to their department, includes teaching, etc.)
- What publications are planned
- What mentored students need along the abovefootnote:[Ideally, students working on interdisciplinary projects will be mentored by someone in their field. If this is not the case, students should keep in close communication with their advisor to ensure that their professional development is on track.]

==== Avoid the Technician Trap

Interdisciplinary researchers can contribute to a project in many ways.
Many times, they contribute distinct technical skills related to their field.
While this contribution can be important to the project as a whole, it may not make for a rewarding experience for the researcher.
Application of technical skills may not count as scholarly output and thus not count towards career advancement.
For example, a computer scientist may write software or a psychologist may run an experiment, but these activities in themselves do not
constitute scholarly products.
Moreover, these activities may be **extremely** time consuming and actually prevent the researcher from engaging in other activities.

When considering a project, researchers should be aware of the technician trap and consider two key questions

- Can I make this successful
- Can this make me successful

If there are conditions attached to these questions, i.e. to be successful, the researcher will need "X," then this is a worthy topic of discussion
and negotiation on the front end of the project.
For example, a psychologist may need to change the design of the experiment to make it publishable in their field,
while still retaining the characteristics needed to advance the project.
Some give and take is needed in any interdisciplinary project to ensure all researchers can benefit from the project.

==== Interdisciplinary Norms for Publishing

Different fields have different norms for publishing.
This can affect who is on the paper, who is first author, and where the paper is published.
It is important to clarify publishing expectations *at the start of the project* when there is no
resource conflict (because the resource, i.e. the opportunity to publish, does not yet exist).

Things to ask:

- What are the criteria for authorship
- Who will take the lead writing up different results
- Who else will be listed as an author on these papers
- Are students expected/encouraged to publish work on this project
- Can a student be first author (assuming that concept is valid; some fields list authors alphabetically)

Remember, in some fields, non-intellectual contributions (e.g. collecting data) do not warrant authorship, and in others,
the PI of a grant may be expected to be on all publications as last author - different fields have different standards.
