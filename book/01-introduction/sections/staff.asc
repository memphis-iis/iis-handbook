[[_staff]]
=== Staff
Most staff are available during academic hours and on an as-needed basis. The major exceptions are
grant preparation and software development.

Grant preparation support is negotiated in advance and
coordinated according to other grant submissions that are due at approximately the same time. This
coordination encourages faculty to notify of intent to submit and work with our grant preparation staff
well in advance of the submission deadline.

Software development likewise is time-intensive for any given project.
Currently, software development support is allocated using an RFP system.
Faculty write a 1-2 page narrative describing how their project
would benefit from software development support.
Support is allocated in 2-month blocks per project on a 6-month cycle.
During any 2-month block, our software development staff member is 100%
committed to the assigned project.
