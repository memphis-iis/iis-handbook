=== Degree Programs

This IIS hosts two degree programs, the Cognitive Science graduate certificate (a graduate program) and the Cognitive Science Minor (an undergraduate program).
Currently, both programs consist of courses hosted by other departments but often taught by IIS Affiliates.
Information about both programs is available at http://www.memphis.edu/cognitive-science/

Importantly,  http://www.memphis.edu/cognitive-science/[that link] lists the specific courses offered in the current/upcoming semester that apply to the certificate and minor,
which should help students when registering for classes.

==== Cognitive Science Graduate Certificate

The certificate is available to all enrolled graduate students from any department.
Additionally, students can be on the certificate as **non-degree-seeking** and by doing so be eligible for GA positions.
Similarly, non-degree-seeking students on the certificate are eligible for financial aid.
So a student between UG and a graduate program may find taking the certificate to be an effective use of their time while they are waiting to be admitted to a graduate program.

Ideally, students interested in the certificate will apply for admission right away, but it is also possible to enter the certificate right before graduating and have previous classes retroactively count toward the certificate (as long as no more than 6 hours are "double counted" towards the certificate and another degree).

Students already enrolled in a graduate program (or who have previously been degree-seeking) can apply to enter the certificate by filling out a change of status form:

http://www.memphis.edu/gradschool/pdfs/forms/changeofstatus.pdf

with degree program as "Graduate Certificate," Major: Cognitive Science.

and then filling out the form, printing/signing, and mailing to the Graduate School or walking over to the Graduate School.

If the student is currently enrolled as non-degree and has never been degree-seeking he or she must complete an online readmit application.

For non-degree students, the IIS graduate coordinator, {iis-graduate-coordinator},
 is the advisor of record and must clear classes each semester.
For degree-seeking students the regular advisor remains the advisor of record;
however feel free to contact me for advice on course selection.

In addition to the listed courses that can count towards the certificate, the graduate coordinator may approve course substitutions.
Faculty are encouraged to contact the graduate coordinator if they are teaching a "one-off" seminar course that is aligned with the certificate or a new course that is similarly aligned.
Students are encouraged to contact the graduate coordinator for advice regarding courses, particularly courses outside their area.

**In the semester of graduation, students on the certificate must fill out the following forms**

- Apply to graduate

- Graduate certificate candidacy form

- Course substitution forms (as needed)

Forms are available at http://www.memphis.edu/gradschool/resources/forms_index.php

{iis-graduate-coordinator} will sign off on the forms and route them for further approval.

The deadlines are listed here:

http://www.memphis.edu/gradschool/current_students/graduation_information/graduation_deadlines.php

**Note that deadlines for graduation paperwork are early in the semester**

Please contact {iis-graduate-coordinator} if you have any questions.

==== Cognitive Science Minor

The minor is available to all undergraduate students **except** Psychology majors.
Psychology majors should instead take the Cognitive Science concentration within the Psychology major.

Unlike the graduate certificate, the minor is largely administered by the College of Arts and Sciences (CAS).
Students wishing to declare the minor should follow the CAS procedure at http://www.memphis.edu/cas/advising/declare_major.php

A student wishing a course substitution or exception should contact the IIS undergraduate coordinator, {iis-undergraduate-coordinator}, who will contact graduation analysts in CAS to make the change.
