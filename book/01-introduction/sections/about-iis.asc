=== About the IIS

What is the Institute for Intelligent Systems?

The Institute for Intelligent Systems (IIS) is an interdisciplinary research center at the University of Memphis.
Unlike many research centers, the IIS has historically pursued a research agenda
set by participating researchers who *self-organize around research problems*,
rather than a highly focused formal agenda.
The breadth and flexibility of the IIS are reflected in our current mission statement:

____
The Institute for Intelligent Systems is dedicated to advancing the state of knowledge and capabilities of intelligent systems, including psychological, biological, and artificial systems.

By conducting cutting-edge research and publishing our findings in peer-reviewed venues, we contribute to the discipline and, ultimately, to the public. In doing so, we are also training the next generation of scientists.

Our mission depends on an interdisciplinary approach that brings together researchers from many different backgrounds, including computer science, cognitive psychology, education, philosophy, linguistics, engineering, English, and biology.
____

TIP: Our "bottom-up" approach to forming research groups makes the IIS very accessible: if
you can find some like-minded people interested in your project, you can form a group.

Although the IIS maintains a strong tradition of bottom-up research, our recent
strategic plan adopted three focus areas:

- Language & Discourse
- Learning
- Artificial Intelligence

These focus areas represent the deepest areas of _current_ expertise at the IIS,
but they should not be regarded as an intention to exclude other areas of research or
limit what the IIS can become in the future.
