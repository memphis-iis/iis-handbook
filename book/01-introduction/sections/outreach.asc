=== Outreach

The IIS engages in outreach and encourages students and faculty to participate.
These activities help promote the IIS brand, attract future students, and help us connect with new collaborators.
Outreach activities can take place on-campus or off-campus.

On-campus, IIS faculty and students are frequently asked to participate in lab tours and
associated demonstrations. Often touring groups are middle or high school students, so
the tours/demonstrations need to be tailored to a general audience.
These are excellent opportunities for graduate students to practice their presentation skills.

Off-campus events include demonstrations at schools or community events, speaking engagements,
competition judging, and similar activities. Often times off-campus outreach is spearheaded by a
particular faculty member, but to the extent possible, the IIS can support these activities by
providing signs or similar materials.
