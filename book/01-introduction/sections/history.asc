=== A Short History of the IIS

The IIS was formed in 1985 as a result of informal meetings between
Dr. Stan Franklin (Computer Science), Dr. Art Graesser (Psychology),
and Dr. Terry Horgan (Philosophy), with Graesser and Franklin initially serving
as Co-Directors.
Dr. Don Franceschetti (Physics) developed a five-year plan
for the IIS which led to the recognition by the State of Tennessee of the IIS
as an Institute.
The Cognitive Science Seminar began in 1985 and continues to this day.

NOTE: The Cognitive Science Seminar has been in continuous operation since 1985.
It is now a cross-listed course with Psychology, Philosophy, and Computer Science.

In 1998, as a result of multiple major grants to faculty participating in the IIS,
the IIS received an operating budget of $25,000, 5% indirect cost recovery from grants,
and two staff positions that were both filled by 2000.

In 2003, the IIS moved to the FedEx Institute of Technology (FIT) and began hiring two
faculty with split appointments between the IIS and other departments.

Beginning in 2007, the IIS began hiring 100% faculty lines.
These lines are fully within the IIS but have tenure housed in other departments.
This development marked a number of administrative changes in the IIS as it
continued to grow into a mini-department.
An additional staff person was added to support grant submissions (i.e. pre-award support)
in recognition of the importance of grant funding to the IIS mission.

In 2010, the IIS was allocated 10 graduate assistantships, additional faculty lines,
additional staff, 20% indirect cost recovery, and the 4th floor of the FIT.
The IIS Student Organization (IISSO) was formed and tasked with managing student
travel awards.
The IIS added its first degree program, the Cognitive Science Graduate Certificate.

In 2014, the IIS launched a multi-year strategic planning process.
Many of the recommendations of the strategic planning process have already been
implemented, including a new undergraduate Minor in Cognitive Science.
However parts of the strategic plan will take years to unfold.
