=== IIS Student Organization (IISSO)

The IIS Student Organization (IISSO) is a self-organized group of students,
most of whom work with IIS Affiliates.
In addition to providing a community for students, the IISSO makes
recommendations to the IIS regarding the allocation of various resources to
students, including student travel awards and thesis/dissertation awards.
The IISSO also organizes the poster session at the Speed Date, guest speaker
lunches, and other social events.

Current information about the IISSO can be found at https://sites.google.com/site/iissomemphis2/

Students and faculty should refer to current information on the website.

===== Qualification for Membership

Any undergraduate or graduate student affiliated with the IIS or with a strong interest in cognitive science interdisciplinary research is able to join and participate in IISSO events.

Membership does not have any strict requirements. To join, simply email the President to have your name added to the mailing list (MUST be your U of M email). The IISSO strives to advance student research by providing opportunities for funding, networking, and promotion of research. As such, members have access to the following benefits: participation in the IISSO research fair (usually toward the end of the Fall and Spring semesters), the opportunity to collaborate with researchers in different fields, as well as the chance to meet and network with experts from outside of the U of M in a variety of cognitive science fields (through the Cognitive Science Seminar lunches), attend and/or present workshops to further your academic career/CV.


While anyone is welcome to join and may benefit from any or all of the abovementioned benefits of membership, limited travel funding (and thesis/dissertation funding) can be awarded to members who meet certain criteria. Specifically, one must be an IISSO member collaborating on a project with an IIS-approved faculty member. Upon joining the IISSO, if you are interested in possibly applying for travel funding in the future, you should check with your advisor or any professor you are collaborating with to see if they are IIS-affiliated and if they have added their students to the list of IISSO-travel-funding-approved students. Even if you meet this requirement (and others detailed on the travel funding page), no one is guaranteed funding. For more information on travel funding, please see the IISSO Funding Page. There is also preliminary information on the Thesis/Dissertation funding on the Funding page. You may also contact any of the current officers with questions or concerns about membership and eligibility.
