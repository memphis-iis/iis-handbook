=== Resources

Resources specific to students and faculty are addressed in their respective chapters. The resources that follow are available to everyone.
Additional resources are listed on the http://www.memphis.edu/iis/resources/index.php[IIS website Resource page].

==== Meeting space

Faculty and students can book meeting rooms with {book-rooms}. In general, booking is on a first-come, first-served basis.

===== Teleconference room

Faculty and students can also book the IIS teleconference system with {book-rooms}.
The system is located in 407 FIT.

The system is an https://enterprise.google.com/chrome/video-conferencing/[enterprise version of Google Hangouts] with the following features

- Accomodates a large group with one screen, camera, and microphone
- Allows a large group of attendees (~20)
- Can connect participants via telephone in addition to Google Hangouts
- For recurring meetings with fixed participants, can automatically start meetings and invite participants based on a calendar event (managed by {book-rooms}).

===== Library

The IIS Library is open to faculty and students at any time.
The library holds a large collection of books donated by faculty (approximately 2,000).

Each book is indexed and cataloged, and may be searched in two ways
- http://www.memphis.edu/iis/resources/index.php[Book metadata such as author and title]
- http://books.google.com/books?uid=113888436009049736112&as_coll=1001&source=gbs_lp_bookshelf_list&hl=en[Full text search using Google Books search restricted to our library]

===== Eyetracker room

The IIS has a "single instrument" experiment room, which currently contains a Tobii T60 Eyetracker.

This room may be booked for single instrument experiments through {book-rooms}.

===== Lab space

Lab space on the 4th floor of the FIT is assigned based on grant funding.
The IIS has a strong history of collegiality with regard to space, with faculty between
grants giving up space in full confidence that when they need it again, other faculty will be equally accomodating.
Additionally, some space has been allocated to IIS faculty lines, who may not have space elsewhere.

Students or faculty without grant funding, who want temporary space, should contact the IIS Director.
Temporary allocations may be warranted for pilot projects that lead to grant funding.

==== Subscriptions and Social media

===== Linguistic Data Consortium subscription (LDC)

The https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/[Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC)] is perhaps the world's leading repository of linguistic data.
LDC datasets are commonly used in shared tasks and to benchmark algorithms.
They can cost thousands of dollars each.

The IIS has an institutional subscription, which gives us total access to each dataset released in a subscription year as well as a reduced price on non-covered datasets.
Datasets in our subscription years are available on campus at http://psychiisnas.memphis.edu/LDC/start.html

Certain datasets require special license agreements. If a dataset appears to be missing, it may require a signature release.
Contact {ldc-manager} for such requests.

===== Dreamspark/Imagine Subscription

The IIS has a DreamSpark subscription. IIS Students, faculty, and staff may download Microsoft titles https://e5.onthehub.com/WebStore/Welcome.aspx?ws=49735311-1b59-e211-b607-f04da23e67f6&vsro=8[from our webstore].

The primary types of software offered are

- Windows operating systems
- SQL server and similar server titles
- Visual studio and similar development tools

Faculty and students can obtain Microsoft Office products directly from the University at http://www.memphis.edu/getoffice

===== GitHub

The IIS maintains a private GitHub account for faculty projects.

===== Google Apps for Education

The IIS maintains its own Google Apps for Education account, which
provides all major Google services except email.


==== Equipment

===== Equipment check out

Various equipment is available for checkout, including

- Projectors
- Google glass

Equipment may be checked out through {checkout}.

===== Computers

Under current federal guidelines, general-purpose computers cannot be charged to grants.
A general purpose computer is any computer not specially configured for a single task.
For example, if a student checks their email or writes a paper on a computer, it is a gneral-purpose computer, but
if a computer's primary purpose is to drive an eyetracker, that is an "unlike circumstance" computer
that can be charged to a grant.

The IIS provides general-purpose computers to support grants.
Typically these computers are replaced on a 3-year cycle.
Older computers replaced on this program are available to all IIS Affiliates
and will be announced as replacement occurs.

===== Printing

The IIS maintains multiple printers, chiefly in 410 FIT.
Like general-purpose computers, these printers are considered
part of general office supplies.
Each computer is attached to the network and can be accessed from any computer.
To do so, walk up to the printer, open its information menu, and write down the IP
address of the printer.
Use this IP address when adding the printer to your computer.
Please keep the printer clean, filled with paper, and report problems to {secretary} as a courtesy to your colleagues.
