=== Events

==== Research Meetings

Individual projects and labs schedule weekly meetings in 405 and 407 FIT,
 the IIS main meeting rooms.
Affiliates can book rooms with {book-rooms}.
 These meetings and descriptions are publicly posted to our website,
 and all IIS Affiliates and students are encouraged to drop in or participate
  in ongoing research meetings.
There are approximately 25 regularly scheduled research meetings per week for
externally funded projects.

==== Cognitive Science Seminar

The Cognitive Science Seminar is a hybrid course/public lecture.
Students who register for the course (COMP/PHIL/PSYC 7514/8514) attend a course-only
portion from 2:20pm to 4pm as well as a guest lecture portion, which is also
open to the public, from 4pm to 5:20pm.

The topic of the seminar varies semester by semester, as do the faculty leading it.
It is common for students to have lunch with guest speakers and for faculty to take them to dinner.
More information about the seminar can be found in the faculty chapter.

==== Guest Speakers

IIS Affiliates will often host visitors who are willing to give a talk to the
wider IIS community.
Although the IIS does not provide material support for such ad-hoc speakers, we
encourage Affiliates to make use of our meeting rooms and work with IIS staff to
promote the talk.

==== Speed Date

At the end of each semester (typically 4pm to 7pm the Friday before Study Day),
the IIS holds a Speed Date event in which 8-10 Affiliates give 5 minute
presentations of their current research interests.
The presentation portion is followed by a wine and cheese poster session,
organized by the IISSO, where students present their latest research.
Affiliates who wish to volunteer to speak at the Speed Date are always welcome to do so,
otherwise Affiliates are invited based on how much time has passed since their
last presentation, with priority given to Affiliates who recently joined.
