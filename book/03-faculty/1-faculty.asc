== Faculty

This chapter is dedicated to faculty.
It assumes you've already read the <<_getting_started,Getting Started>> chapter.
If you have not read that, go back and read it now!
You might also want to read the <<_students,Students>> chapter so you know what
your students are supposed to know.

The IIS is primarily geared toward supporting faculty research.
We do that by providing resources and services.
These resources and services are designed to help you do pilot work for grants,
submit grants, lead grants, and wind down grants.

Why do we focus so much on grants?
While research does not need to be backed by a grant to be worthwhile,
the IIS is almost entirely funded by grant activity through indirect cost recovery
and salary buyout from its faculty lines.
Without ongoing grant activity, the IIS would have to eliminate many of the resources we currently provide.
Eventually, a lack of grant activity would probably lead to our staff being reassigned to other units.
In other words, grants are an existential concern for the IIS, and we give priority to
activities that support faculty through the grant life cycle.
