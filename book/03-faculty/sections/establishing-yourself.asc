=== Establishing yourself

At the end of the day, the IIS is a community of researchers above everything else.
When you are new, or trying to move your research in a new direction, how do you
establish yourself?
The IIS provides several community building activities for faculty.

==== Cognitive Science Seminar

If you decide to lead it, the seminar is an excellent venue for giving other faculty a **deep** look at
your research area.
Even if you are just a participant, the seminar is the best way to help with your optics.

TIP: If you don't attend the seminar regularly, people probably won't know who you are.

Leading the seminar can be very helpful for new faculty or faculty interested in
pursuing a new research direction.
The seminar lets you engage other IIS Affiliates for an entire semester - it is comparable
to them sitting in a class on your research area for a whole semester.
Because other Affiliates know your area better, your leading the seminar creates
a natural context for collaborative projects and proposals.

The seminar traditionally has invited speakers for at least some of the public talks,
and the IIS provides {cogsci-funding-level} for these speaker's travel, hotel,
and meals.
The speakers can be faculty with whom you're already collaborating or would like to
collaborate, so having invited speakers can also advance your research agenda.
Speakers typically have a lunch with students, which presumably includes your students,
and are taken to dinner by faculty, again presumably you and faculty who either
already overlap in terms of research or who you'd like to recruit into that area.

The seminar is cross listed with three departments (PSYC/PHIL/COMP) and is a required
course for the CogSci graduate certificate.
Faculty leading the seminar often recruit students from other departments into their labs
by getting to know them in the course.
The format of the course is typically discussion based, with a final paper/project.
These details can be changed as needed, but it is important to remember that
because the class is cross listed, assignments need to be suitable for students from different backgrounds.
One way to handle this is to give slightly different options for assignments depending
on how the student registered for the class (i.e. under PSYC vs. under COMP).

Finally, the seminar is very popular with Affiliates and is usually booked a year in advance.
So if you're thinking about leading a seminar, talk to the IIS Director, {director}, right away.

==== Speed Date

The Speed Date has some of the same advantages for establishing yourself as the
CogSci Seminar, but is a much smaller commitment.
It can be useful for getting yourself introduced to the community if you haven't had a chance
to lead a CogSci Seminar yet.
Faculty sometimes get a little too focused on their 5-minute presentation;
while that is important the reception afterwards is also important.
The reception will give you a chance to talk to other faculty while your presentation
is fresh on their minds.
Also, if you have students with posters, their presentations to other faculty can
be a great way to get your message out.

==== Getting on projects

The IIS has a tradition of being very welcoming to faculty.
If there is an established project that you think you might be interested in, talk to the
faculty leading the project and see if it would make sense to sit in.
By sitting in on a project you will get to know other faculty's research and have
opportunities for collaboration that might lead to publications.
