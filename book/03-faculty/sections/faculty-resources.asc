=== Faculty resources

The IIS provides various resources, but with the exception of staff time and a portion
of our graduate assistantships, availability of these resources need to be confirmed
each year as funds become available.
Unfortunately it is difficult for the IIS to declare availability by a specific date,
for example, September 1st, because our indirect cost recovery funds are not released to us
predictably.

==== Graduate assistantships

The IIS assigns GAs to our faculty lines (which often don't receive departmental support: {iis-lines-tenure-track}),
then to IIS grantees whose external grants have ended and need "bridging" support between grants,
and then to the IIS generally.
The IIS has a strong tradition of faculty not abusing this arrangement;
it is relatively common for our faculty lines to release their GA slots back to the
pool when they have grants to support their students.

Each year in late spring, assuming that any slots are unfilled, the IIS issues a
request for proposals to all Affiliates for 1-year GAs that start the following fall.
The 1-year GAs are non-renewable, cover up to {ga-tuition-hours} hours of tuition
(any additional hours must be approved on a case by case basis), and are paid
{ga-stipend-premasters}/month for pre-masters students and {ga-stipend-postmasters}/month
for post-masters students.

Faculty proposals should be 1-2 pages in length and include
(1) what the student would work on
(2) how the student is currently funded
(3) how the student's efforts will mesh with your own efforts to gain future external support.

Faculty who are not planning to submit are encouraged to volunteer to review the proposals.

==== Software development support

The IIS currently solicits proposals for software developer time on a six month cycle.
Each cycle consists of two-month assignments to three different projects.
After two months support will shift to the next project, so establishing sustainability/continuity on each project is key.
That means that other personnel should work closely our senior software developer, {software-developer},
so that they can function independently after the two-month assignment ends.
Faculty receiving assignments will be asked to provide feedback on {software-developer}'s
performance for annual evaluation purposes.

What can a software developer do? The items below are taken directly from {software-developer}'s job description:

- Develops large and complex system projects and prototype implementations by participating in and overseeing the design, coding, testing, debugging and documentation activities of project staff.
- Establishes project plans and schedules and monitors progress, providing status reports as required.
- Conducts detailed systems analysis to define system scope, objectives and implementation approach. Entails attending research meetings and collaboratively working with research staff, faculty, and students.
- Develops system definition, architecture and detailed needs analysis including hardware and software recommendations based on system analysis.
- Maintains versioning, code repositories, and releases of grant-developed software to prevent past research from being lost or becoming obsolete due to hardware changes.
- Contributes text to project reports and technical papers.
- Establishes and implements user training programs, tutorials and other materials necessary to present and support research results.
- Maintains testing suites and runs regression tests on software to ensure that software modifications do not negatively impact past research.
- Responsible for technical presentations and system demonstrations (preparation, setup, and delivery) at conferences and funder events.
- Responsible for new developments and technologies by reading journals and other pertinent publications.
- Performs other duties as directed or required.

==== Travel support

Travel funds are provided for the following activities:

- To support conference travel where the faculty member is presenting a peer-reviewed publication (or equivalent by discipline)
- To support travel to sponsor meetings for the purpose of obtaining new funding (typically DoD)

Sponsor meetings that are part of existing grant obligations should be funded by those grants, and
grant-related travel should be funded by grants.

The funding amounts are {faculty-affiliate-travel}/yr for Affiliates and {faculty-line-travel}/yr for IIS faculty lines.

Travel authorization paperwork and reimbursement will be handled by the IIS.

==== Laptops for PIs

A laptop is provided to PIs with a new grant award,
but no more than once every two years per PI.

==== Staff
