=== Grant life cycle

Obtaining and managing grants can be fairly complex.
The IIS has a variety of resources and staff support to help.
Probably the best way to think about grants is in terms of a life cycle.

. Idea
. Finding opportunities
. Forming a team
. Proposal
. Award
. Opening a Banner Fund
. Spending appropriately
. Covering overages
. Fiscal reporting
. Closing the account

==== Idea

It all starts with an idea.
Ideas can come from many places, but at the IIS we have a particular orientation
towards interdisciplinary research.

[quote, Committee on Facilitating Interdisciplinary Research,  Facilitating interdisciplinary research. 2004. p. 2.]
____
Interdisciplinary research is a mode of research by teams or individuals that integrates information, data, techniques, tools, perspectives, concepts, and/or theories from two or more disciplines or bodies of specialized knowledge to advance fundamental understanding or to solve problems whose solutions are beyond the scope of a single discipline or area of research practice.
____

How do you have an interdisciplinary idea?
Most likely by working with people from other disciplines, learning about those
disciplines, and making the connection between your discipline and those disciplines.
This should happen naturally as you participate in the IIS community.
A complementary approach is to look for authentic problems in city, county, or
state where you can make both a research contribution and a societal contribution.

==== Finding opportunities

There are many different types of grants:

* Federal grants
** Department of Defense
** Institute for Education Sciences
** National Institutes of Health
** National Science Foundation
** *Any federal agency over a certain size is likely to have some kind of grant program*
* Industry grants
** Microsoft
** Amazon
** *Industry usually funds grants only in areas relevant to them*
* Foundations
** Toyota USA Foundation
** John Templeton Foundation
** Spencer Foundation
** *Foundations often have specific causes that they fund*

Most sponsors have multiple opportunities at any given time, which means that
there are literally hundreds or thousands of opportunities to navigate.

There are several strategies you can use to find potential sponsors:

[horizontal]
Meet with {:pre-award-coordinator:}:: Meet and discuss your area and interests so {:pre-award-coordinator:}
can search existing opportunities and forward future opportunities to you.
Talk to colleagues:: Usually the funders of a research area are well established.
Colleagues at the IIS or your department likely can make good recommendations.
Read acknowledgements:: Most grants require acknowledgement in publications.
When reading papers in your field, make a note of who funded the research.
For federal grants there is often a grant ID mentioned that can be used to find
a complete public record of the grant on the web.
Explore:: Especially for the larger federal sponsors, it is worthwhile to spend
some time exploring their opportunities at a high level so you know how they
are structured. For example, NSF is hierarchically structured with funding programs
under divisions under directorates.
Try a recommendation service:: The university has been experimenting with
various services that recommend grants to faculty based on their profiles, like
https://www.grantforward.com/[GrantForward].

==== Forming a team

You may decide to form a team before the proposal stage or during the proposal
stage.
The advantage of forming a team beforehand (or alternatively working with faculty
  beforehand) is that you will have a better idea of each team members strengths
  and research interests.
If you form a team during the proposal phase, you will have an extra layer of
complexity in figuring out how to organize the team.
This can be particularly complicated if you are working across institutions on
a large project.

==== Proposal

It is very important that you disclose your intent to submit (even if it is tentative)
to {:pre-award-coordinator:} as early as possible and more than a month before
the submission deadline.

It is also important to understand that {:pre-award-coordinator:} does not have
complete control over your proposal submission.
{:pre-award-coordinator:}'s job is to:

- Read all the requirements of the solicitation
- Track, and to the extent possible, create all required proposal components
- Get approvals (particularly budget) from our Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP)
- Route a Proposal Summary Form through Cayuse to get signatures from chairs and deans

{:pre-award-coordinator:} does not submit the final proposal.
When the proposal is finalized, {:pre-award-coordinator:} will notify OSP,
and OSP will add any additional institutional information and submit the proposal.
Therefore it is very important to have the proposal ready before the sponsor's
deadline so that {:pre-award-coordinator:} can pass the proposal to OSP in time
for them to do their job.
