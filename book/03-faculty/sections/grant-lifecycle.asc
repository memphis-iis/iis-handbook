=== Grant life cycle

Obtaining and managing grants can be fairly complex.
The IIS has a variety of resources and staff support to help.
Probably the best way to think about grants is in terms of a life cyclefootnote:[A significant portion of the content in this section comes from the presentation, "Managing Your Grant and Contract Funds," by the Department of Instruction and Curriculum Leadership.]

==== Idea

It all starts with an idea.
Ideas can come from many places, but at the IIS we have a particular orientation
towards interdisciplinary research.

[quote, Committee on Facilitating Interdisciplinary Research,  Facilitating interdisciplinary research. 2004. p. 2.]
____
Interdisciplinary research is a mode of research by teams or individuals that integrates information, data, techniques, tools, perspectives, concepts, and/or theories from two or more disciplines or bodies of specialized knowledge to advance fundamental understanding or to solve problems whose solutions are beyond the scope of a single discipline or area of research practice.
____

How do you have an interdisciplinary idea?
Most likely by working with people from other disciplines, learning about those
disciplines, and making the connection between your discipline and those disciplines.
This should happen naturally as you participate in the IIS community.
A complementary approach is to look for authentic problems in city, county, or
state where you can make both a research contribution and a societal contribution.

==== Finding opportunities

There are many different types of grants:

* Federal grants
** Department of Defense
** Institute for Education Sciences
** National Institutes of Health
** National Science Foundation
** *Any federal agency over a certain size is likely to have some kind of grant program*
* Industry grants
** Microsoft
** Amazon
** *Industry usually funds grants only in areas relevant to them*
* Foundations
** Toyota USA Foundation
** John Templeton Foundation
** Spencer Foundation
** *Foundations often have specific causes that they fund*

Most sponsors have multiple opportunities at any given time, which means that
there are literally hundreds or thousands of opportunities to navigate.

There are several strategies you can use to find potential sponsors:

[horizontal]
Meet with {:pre-award-coordinator:}:: Meet and discuss your area and interests so {:pre-award-coordinator:}
can search existing opportunities and forward future opportunities to you.
Talk to colleagues:: Usually the funders of a research area are well established.
Colleagues at the IIS or your department likely can make good recommendations.
Read acknowledgements:: Most grants require acknowledgement in publications.
When reading papers in your field, make a note of who funded the research.
For federal grants there is often a grant ID mentioned that can be used to find
a complete public record of the grant on the web.
Explore:: Especially for the larger federal sponsors, it is worthwhile to spend
some time exploring their opportunities at a high level so you know how they
are structured. For example, NSF is hierarchically structured with funding programs
under divisions under directorates.
Try a recommendation service:: The university has been experimenting with
various services that recommend grants to faculty based on their profiles, like
https://www.grantforward.com/[GrantForward].

==== Forming a team

You may decide to form a team before the proposal stage or during the proposal
stage.
The advantage of forming a team beforehand (or alternatively working with faculty
  beforehand) is that you will have a better idea of each team members strengths
  and research interests.
If you form a team during the proposal phase, you will have an extra layer of
complexity in figuring out how to organize the team.
This can be particularly complicated if you are working across institutions on
a large project.

==== Proposal

It is very important that you disclose your intent to submit (even if it is tentative)
to {:pre-award-coordinator:} as early as possible and more than a month before
the submission deadline.

It is also important to understand that {:pre-award-coordinator:} does not have
complete control over your proposal submission.
{:pre-award-coordinator:}'s job is to:

- Read all the requirements of the solicitation
- Track, and to the extent possible, create all required proposal components
- Get approvals (particularly budget) from our Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP)
- Route a Proposal Summary Form through Cayuse to get signatures from chairs and deans

{:pre-award-coordinator:} does not submit the final proposal.
When the proposal is finalized, {:pre-award-coordinator:} will notify OSP,
and OSP will add any additional institutional information and submit the proposal.
Therefore it is very important to have the proposal ready before the sponsor's
deadline so that {:pre-award-coordinator:} can pass the proposal to OSP in time
for them to do their job.

=== Responsibilities

The PI is ultimately responsible for the grant. This includes:

- Managing personnel
- Spending money appropriately consistent with sponsor guidelines and project goals
- Writing reports
- Talking to program officer
- Certifying and approving effort

The IIS provides additional support, both at the pre-award stage as discussed above,
and at the post-award stage with the following:

- Purchasing
- HR actions like GA contracts
- Budget oversight and reports (on a month or semester basis)
- Compliance with UoM policies and federal guidelines
- Advance account requests

Grants accounting and the IIS work together closely to handle the actual spending
and invoicing of the award.
Grants accounting also plays an important role in
the initial set up of the award in the Banner financial system:

- Set up index, positions, salary splits (**effort**), cost share
- Loosely monitor budget and time (on a year to year basis)
- Invoice the sponsor; coordinate with sponsor for regarding billing
- Review and approve/reject charges
- Process budget revisions and approve/reject revisions

The Office of Sponsored Projects handles what you might consider contractual issues
with the sponsor and award.
Most of these actions occur at or before the award is made:

- Proposal submission
- Notification and processing of the award
- Subcontracts

=== Effort

For federal compliance, grant personnel (faculty, students, and staff) are required
to report effort.
At the University of Memphis, effort is reported three times a year: fall, spring,
and summer semesters.
Faculty effort will typically be 100% in their department.
When a grant is awarded that has faculty effort during one of the three effort
reporting periods, faculty effort during that period is reallocated from the
department to the grant.
This is one of several reasons why the department chair, as financial manager
of the department, has to approve the grant proposal before submission.

Faculty who are overseeing a funded student during the academic year should have some
effort during the academic year consistent with that supervisory role.
As a general rule, effort should be reported when it is expended.
Some sponsors, e.g. NSF, allow for very little effort on grants, and faculty may
feel pressured to expend/report that effort during the summer.
In such cases it may be appropriate to request *cost share*, which is a way for
the university to sponsor some of your effort on the project.
It is important to understand that cost share becomes part of your effort, and
you cannot double count cost shared effort across projects.
Cost share is a somewhat complicated subject, but essentially can be
voluntary/mandatory and committed/uncommitted.
The first factor corresponds to whether it is required in the proposal, and the
second factor corresponds to whether cost share is specified in the proposal/budget
and is therefore contractually binding.
Returning to the NSF example, it may be appropriate for faculty to request a
voluntary uncommitted cost share (which NSF allows) of 10%, which approximately
equals one course.
Such a cost share would then appear on effort certification.

Effort not only has implications for effort reporting but also for faculty
compensation.
The University of Memphis offers some extremely competitive incentive policies.
The first, summer salary, is typically available at research universities.
Through this program, any effort during the summer charged to the grant is paid
out to the faculty member proportional to their 9-month salary.
The second program is called *incentive pay* and applies to the academic year.
During this time period, the faculty member's salary could been seen as supported
by the grant, with the university saving the cost.
However, the University of Memphis pays the faculty member's salary and gives
the faculty member **up to half** of the grant-charged effort.
Incentive pay requires the chair's approval and the department must be reimbursed
for any grant-incurred costs, like replacement instructors.
When both of these incentive policies are considered, a 9-month faculty member
who is 100% effort on grants will make 1 + 1/3 + 1/2 = 1.83 times their base salary.

Another incentive policy indirectly tied to effort is indirect cost recovery.
The University of Memphis has an indirect cost rate (or facilities and administration rate)
negotiated with the federal government, meaning that all federal grants are
charged the same rate for overhead costs like electricity, heat, cleaning, etc.
The University of Memphis redirects these funds to various sources, including
the college, research center, department, and investigators, based on the dollars
spent on the grant in the previous fiscal year.
How is this tied to effort?
When the proposal summary form is created, there is a item for *shared credit*
between faculty on the proposal.
This shared credit will be used to determine future splits of indirect cost
recovery between the units listed above.
Although there is no set policy for determining shared credit, one way that PI's
may wish to calculate it is by looking at their effort as a proportion of total
effort on the project.
For example, if a faculty member is contributing 1 month of effort to a proposal
where the total effort by all faculty is 4 months, then that faculty member's
shared credit could be estimated as 25%.
