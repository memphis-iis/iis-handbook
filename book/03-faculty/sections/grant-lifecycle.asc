=== Grant Responsibilities

The PI is ultimately responsible for the grant. This includes:

- Managing personnel
- Spending money appropriately consistent with sponsor guidelines and project goals
- Writing reports
- Talking to the program officer
- Certifying and approving effort

The IIS provides additional support, both at the pre-award stage
and at the post-award stage with the following:

- Purchasing
- HR actions like GA contracts
- Budget oversight and reports (on a month or semester basis)
- Compliance with UoM policies and federal guidelines
- Advance account requests

Grants accounting and the IIS work together closely to handle the actual spending
and invoicing of the award.
Grants accounting also plays an important role in
the initial set up of the award in the Banner financial system:

- Set up index, positions, salary splits (**effort**), cost share
- Loosely monitor budget and time (on a year to year basis)
- Invoice the sponsor; coordinate with sponsor for regarding billing
- Review and approve/reject charges
- Process budget revisions and approve/reject revisions

The Office of Sponsored Projects handles what you might consider contractual issues
with the sponsor and award.
Most of these actions occur at or before the award is made:

- Proposal submission
- Notification and processing of the award
- Subcontracts


=== Grant life cycle

Obtaining and managing grants can be fairly complex.
The IIS has a variety of resources and staff support to help.
Probably the best way to think about grants is in terms of a life cyclefootnote:[Some of the content in this section comes from the presentation, "Managing Your Grant and Contract Funds," by the Department of Instruction and Curriculum Leadership.]

==== Idea

It all starts with an idea.
Ideas can come from many places, but at the IIS we have a particular orientation
towards interdisciplinary research.

[quote, Committee on Facilitating Interdisciplinary Research,  Facilitating interdisciplinary research. 2004. p. 2.]
____
Interdisciplinary research is a mode of research by teams or individuals that integrates information, data, techniques, tools, perspectives, concepts, and/or theories from two or more disciplines or bodies of specialized knowledge to advance fundamental understanding or to solve problems whose solutions are beyond the scope of a single discipline or area of research practice.
____

How do you have an interdisciplinary idea?
Most likely by working with people from other disciplines, learning about those
disciplines, and making the connection between your discipline and those disciplines.
This should happen naturally as you participate in the IIS community.
A complementary approach is to look for authentic problems in city, county, or
state where you can make both a research contribution and a societal contribution.

==== Finding opportunities

There are many different types of grants:

* Federal grants
** Department of Defense
** Institute for Education Sciences
** National Institutes of Health
** National Science Foundation
** *Any federal agency over a certain size is likely to have some kind of grant program*
* Industry grants
** Microsoft
** Amazon
** *Industry usually funds grants only in areas relevant to them*
* Foundations
** Toyota USA Foundation
** John Templeton Foundation
** Spencer Foundation
** *Foundations often have specific causes that they fund*

Most sponsors have multiple opportunities at any given time, which means that
there are literally hundreds or thousands of opportunities to navigate.

There are several strategies you can use to find potential sponsors:

[horizontal]
Meet with {pre-award-coordinator}:: Meet and discuss your area and interests so {pre-award-coordinator}
can search existing opportunities and forward future opportunities to you.
Talk to colleagues:: Usually the funders of a research area are well established.
Colleagues at the IIS or your department likely can make good recommendations.
Read acknowledgements:: Most grants require acknowledgement in publications.
When reading papers in your field, make a note of who funded the research.
For federal grants there is often a grant ID mentioned that can be used to find
a complete public record of the grant on the web.
Explore:: Especially for the larger federal sponsors, it is worthwhile to spend
some time exploring their opportunities at a high level so you know how they
are structured. For example, NSF is hierarchically structured with funding programs
under divisions under directorates.
Try a recommendation service:: The university has been experimenting with
various services that recommend grants to faculty based on their profiles, like
https://www.grantforward.com/[GrantForward].

==== Forming a team

You may decide to form a team before the proposal stage or during the proposal
stage.
The advantage of forming a team beforehand (or alternatively working with faculty
  beforehand) is that you will have a better idea of each team members strengths
  and research interests.
If you form a team during the proposal phase, you will have an extra layer of
complexity in figuring out how to organize the team.
This can be particularly complicated if you are working across institutions on
a large project.

==== Proposal

It is very important that you disclose your intent to submit (even if it is tentative)
to {pre-award-coordinator} as early as possible and more than a month before
the submission deadline.

It is also important to understand that {pre-award-coordinator} does not have
complete control over your proposal submission.
{pre-award-coordinator}'s job is to:

- Read all the requirements of the solicitation
- Track, and to the extent possible, create all required proposal components
- Get approvals (particularly budget) from our Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP)
- Route a Proposal Summary Form through Cayuse to get signatures from chairs and deans.

IMPORTANT: The Proposal Summary Form must be completed correctly for the IIS to get indirect cost recovery!

{pre-award-coordinator} does not submit the final proposal.
When the proposal is finalized, {pre-award-coordinator} will notify OSP,
and OSP will add any additional institutional information and submit the proposal.
Therefore it is very important to have the proposal ready before the sponsor's
deadline so that {pre-award-coordinator} can pass the proposal to OSP in time
for them to do their job.

On of the most important aspects of the proposal is the budget, because it
determines almost everything else.
When you meet with {pre-award-coordinator} to prepare the budget, there are
several things to be particularly cognizant of:

- Travel
- Computers
- Students
- Staff
- Effort


===== Travel

Some sponsors limit travel and some do not.
Many sponsors **require** travel to coordinate with the sponsor (e.g. DoD and IES).
Do not handicap your budget by eliminating **necessary** travel!
If your project has dissemination goals, budget travel to advance those goals.
Travel should be calculated based on these goals and the number of personnel on
the project who are advancing these goals.

For example, if students are going to be involved in dissemination, set reasonable
targets for the number of conferences students will present the research at given
their current development (e.g. 1 per year or 2 per year).
Although the IIS will fund student conference travel, it is entirely appropriate
to fund travel directly off the grant when the travel meets project goals.

Finally, the University requires separate line items for international and domestic
travel.
Make sure to put some funds into international travel if there is **any** chance
you will need to travel internationally.

===== Computers

Computers used to be considered special equipment.
Now they are considered office supplies, meaning they cannot be charged to a grant
**unless** they fulfill a special purpose.
This is called an *unlike circumstance*.

Any computer that is being used by graduate students for purposes like checking
email, doing classwork, or writing their thesis, cannot be treated as an unlike
circumstance.
An unlike circumstance would be appropriate for a computer driving a piece of
equipment like any eyetracker, a computer only used for experiments, a computer
used for advanced software development, or a server.
Any unlike circumstance computer can be directly charged to the grant.
The IIS will only provide computers for funded projects if they fall into the
category of office supplies.

===== Students

There are https://bf.memphis.edu/spectrum/hr/eclass.php[many ways to hire students] on a grant:
Each of these has its own rules, and it beyond the of scope of this document to
discuss all the rules and restrictions that apply to all categories, particularly
those involving different kinds of visa restrictions for international students.
However, some salient issues are briefly noted:

====== Graduate Assistants

Graduate assistants (GAs) on contract for a **maximum** of 20 hours a month and
are compensated with some combination of tuition and stipend.
It is recommended that tuition and stipend are matched dollar for dollar, e.g.
10 hours and half tuition, though flexibility is possible.
Funding agencies typically place no upper limit on stipend amount, so you can
pay your students whatever you think is fair and competitive.
**You will not make your grant more likely to be funded by underpaying your
students.**
Please do not intentionally "split-fund" students across grants and departments.
This creates unnecessary complexity, both in terms of contracts and in terms of
effort reporting.
You are encouraged to fully fund students on grants at a competitive wage.
Finally, 9 hours is considered full enrollment and is required for departmental
GAs and international GAs until they finish their coursework.
However, cost variations from 9 hours can occur: students who are domestic and
choose to take less may cost less, some programs require more than 9 hours, and
some classes/programs have additional fees.
It is important to consider all of these factors when planning the GA portion of
your budget.

====== Student employees

Student employees http://www.memphis.edu/financialaid/pdfs/se_employer_handbook.pdf[must be students enrolled in a minimum number of hours and are
capped at 25 hours per week].
By definition, student employees cannot have another position like a GA.
As a result, it is more common for student employees to be undergraduate students
than graduate students, but it is possible for graduate students to also be
student employees.
From a budgeting perspective, choosing an hourly rate, number of hours, and
number of employees makes calculating these costs fairly straightforward.

===== Staff

There are more restrictions on grant funded staff than on students.
Depending on the sponsor, you may not be allowed to hire staff to do a particular
kind of work.
For example, you may not be allowed to hire staff to do clerical work.
As with student employees, it is beyond the scope of this document to discuss
all staff hiring and employment related issues, but a few are briefly noted.

====== Temporary employees

Temporary employees are the easiest to hire.
The hiring process does not typically involve a formal search.
However, temps have limited duration employment (less than a year) and do not receive full benefits.
They must work 100% on the grant that funds them.

====== Regular employees

Regular employees on a grant must go through the same hiring process for any staff
member at the university.
Therefore it may take 2-3 months to complete a hire.
They have no duration (except the lifetime of the grant that pays them) and
receive full benefits.
Importantly their position is tied to the grant and ends when the grant ends.
They must work 100% on the grant that funds them.

====== Limited positions

Limited positions do not exist within grants but may be funded by grants.
List regular employees, they must go through a full search process.
Limited positions exist at the department level or above, extend beyond the lifetime
of the grant (as long as there is another funding source), and may be split
across projects.
In theory, limited positions are most appropriate for high-value employees who
are funded by grants and who wish to remain at the university for an extended
period of time.
In practice, however, staff who start in other positions and then go through the
hiring process to obtain a limited position usually do not stay longer than an additional year.

Missing from the above discussion are postdocs, research faculty, and research
scientists.
These are all considered to have faculty status, rather than staff status, and so
follow the normal faculty hiring and employment processes.
These positions may be set up as limited positions or they may not.

===== Effort

For federal compliance, grant personnel (faculty, students, and staff) are required
to report effort.
At the University of Memphis, effort is reported three times a year: fall, spring,
and summer semesters.
Faculty effort will typically be 100% in their department.
When a grant is awarded that has faculty effort during one of the three effort
reporting periods, faculty effort during that period is reallocated from the
department to the grant.
This is one of several reasons why the department chair, as financial manager
of the department, has to approve the grant proposal before submission.

Faculty who are overseeing a funded student during the academic year should have some
effort during the academic year consistent with that supervisory role.
As a general rule, effort should be reported when it is expended.
Some sponsors, e.g. NSF, allow for very little effort on grants, and faculty may
feel pressured to expend/report that effort during the summer.
In such cases it may be appropriate to request *cost share*, which is a way for
the university to sponsor some of your effort on the project.
It is important to understand that cost share becomes part of your effort, and
you cannot double count cost shared effort across projects.
Cost share is a somewhat complicated subject, but essentially can be
voluntary/mandatory and committed/uncommitted.
The first factor corresponds to whether it is required in the proposal, and the
second factor corresponds to whether cost share is specified in the proposal/budget
and is therefore contractually binding.
Returning to the NSF example, it may be appropriate for faculty to request a
voluntary uncommitted cost share (which NSF allows) of 10%, which approximately
equals one course.
Such a cost share would then appear on effort certification.

Effort not only has implications for effort reporting but also for faculty
compensation.
The University of Memphis offers some extremely competitive incentive policies.
The first, summer salary, is typically available at research universities.
Through this program, any effort during the summer charged to the grant is paid
out to the faculty member proportional to their 9-month salary.
The second program is called *incentive pay* and applies to the academic year.
During this time period, the faculty member's salary could been seen as supported
by the grant, with the university saving the cost.
However, the University of Memphis pays the faculty member's salary and gives
the faculty member **up to half** of the grant-charged effort.
Incentive pay requires the chair's approval and the department must be reimbursed
for any grant-incurred costs, like replacement instructors.
When both of these incentive policies are considered, a 9-month faculty member
who is 100% effort on grants will make 1 + 1/3 + 1/2 = 1.83 times their base salary.

Another incentive policy indirectly tied to effort is indirect cost recovery.
The University of Memphis has an indirect cost rate (or facilities and administration rate)
negotiated with the federal government, meaning that all federal grants are
charged the same rate for overhead costs like electricity, heat, cleaning, etc.
The University of Memphis redirects these funds to various sources, including
the college, research center, department, and investigators, based on the dollars
spent on the grant in the previous fiscal year.
How is this tied to effort?
When the proposal summary form is created, there is a item for *shared credit*
between faculty on the proposal.
This shared credit will be used to determine future splits of indirect cost
recovery between the units listed above.
Although there is no set policy for determining shared credit, one way that PI's
may wish to calculate it is by looking at their effort as a proportion of total
effort on the project.
For example, if a faculty member is contributing 1 month of effort to a proposal
where the total effort by all faculty is 4 months, then that faculty member's
shared credit could be estimated as 25%.


==== Award

Notification of the award will usually be communicated from the sponsor to the
Office of Sponsored Projects.
You may or may not be cc'd on that initial notification.
Office of Sponsored Projects will process and approve the award and then notify you.
OSP's approval will trigger grants accounting to set up one or more accounts
Banner according to your budget.
You budget will be grants accounting's blueprint for setting everything up,
including effort and positions.
Some grants are structured such that you will receive a new award notification each
year.
Similarly a no-cost extension may be processed with a new award notification.
However, additional years and NCEs usually do not trigger the creation of new
accounts in Banner.

==== Implementation

===== Spending appropriately

{financial-services-associate} and {business-officer} will help you spend
grant funds appropriately.
Typically this means proper allocation of summer salary, academic year incentive,
student contracts, equipment purchases, and travel.
It is important to understand that some costs are *allowable* and some costs are not.
Allowable costs are:

- Allowed by the sponsor
- Allocable to the project
- Reasonable and prudent costs
- Consistent costs
- Conform to university policies and regulations
- Conform to OMB Circular A-21

IIS staff and grants accounting will guide you regarding allowable costs.

===== Purchasing

There are http://bf.memphis.edu/bfguide/10191.htm[three primary ways of purchasing].
The simplest is the purchasing card held by {purchasing-card}.
The P-card can be used for online vendors, like Amazon, if the price is low.
The next easiest is TigerBuy.
Many pre-approved vendors are on TigerBuy and have specialized web portals that
the university can use to buy goods at a pre-approved rate.
Finally, the university has a bidding process for expensive products where there is
not already a vendor agreement in place and the product is not sole-source.
Different purchases will follow different procedures with corresponding timeframes
for completion.

===== Hiring

Hiring GAs tends to be fairly straightforward, with no search required,
and the university has an e-contract system in place to facilitate.
Hiring staff and faculty-equivalent positions, however, requires following
http://umwa.memphis.edu/umpolicies/UM1495.htm[the university's general hiring procedures.]
Briefly stated, hiring regular staff requires

1. A position number backed with 1 year's salary (or more)
2. A position posting which must be approved at multiple levels and be publicly
available for two weeks
3. Interviews of candidates
4. A hiring proposal, which is followed by a background check and various approvals

A timeline of 1-2 months to complete these steps would be a reasonable expectation.

Faculty-equivalent searches are much the same except they have a committee involved
in all decisions, a broader advertisement plan, and a longer posting period.
These additional factors typically add 1-2 months to the process.

===== Budget changes

Changes to the budget are inevitable.
Common reasons for budgetary changes include delays in filling positions,
changing price of equipment, and change in faculty effort.
It is important to note that some changes require the approval of the sponsor.

Any change to the budget will affect when the project runs out of money.
Therefore the PI should work with IIS staff on a new budget any time a significant
expense adjustment occurs, e.g. a student funded by the project graduates.
Because some funding categories incur indirect costs and some do not, be very
careful when planning to spend funds by moving them across categories.
For example, unspent student funding that is moved to faculty effort would need to
have indirect costs applied.
Failure to remove indirect costs in this case would result in overspending.
As always, IIS staff are your best guide.

Very importantly, if personnel effort changes, grants accounting must be notified.
Personnel effort has implications for payroll and effort reporting.
These systems are essentially automatic once they are set up (at the award stage).
Work with IIS staff to make sure effort changes are reported to grants accounting
in time to be reflected in payroll at the start of the semester.

====  Closing down

Many sponsors allow for a *no-cost extension (NCE)* of the grant.
This is usually a 1-year extension, with no additional funding, in which the PI
can wrap up the project and spend down the remaining funds.
It is sometimes possible to get a second no-cost extension, but these are
typically scrutinized very carefully.
Sponsors usually consider it inappropriate for a PI to plan on a no-cost extension
before the last 3-6 months of the project.
However, towards the end of the project, if project goals have not been fully
advanced, it is wise for the PI to investigate sponsor rules for requesting
an NCE.

When the grant is really going to end, it is important to closely monitor spending.
Ideally all grant funds would be spent on allowable costs.
Unspent funds will not be available after the grant project period ends.
Overspending will not be charged to the sponsor but instead to the PI's indirect
cost recovery account and then, if the PI's account is exhausted, to the PI's department.

It is particularly important to plan for grant staff separation.
This only applies to grant staff and not students or base-budget faculty.
Grant staff have benefits, like annual leave, that, if they have not been taking leave,
will get charged to the grant on separation.
Annual leave benefits accrued by limited positions on previous grants can also
be charged to your grant if they are separating from the university.
