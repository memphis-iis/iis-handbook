== Introduction

*Chapter 1* is for everyone.
It speaks to interdisciplinary researchers regardless of where they are in their careers.
Interdisciplinary research is hard.
To be successful, we have to step outside our disciplinary perspectives and be willing to learn and to be challenged.
This means not only learning about other disciplines, which have their own literature, methods, and approach to knowledge,
but also learning to work on teams with members of other disciplines.
We have to consider how these issues impact student milestones and professional development,
as well as tenure and career advancement for faculty.
Within a university that has traditional departments, we must all understand how
interdisciplinary research impacts typical departmental procedures from both an
academic (e.g., committee composition) and finance (e.g., course buyout) perspective.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide a common ground for everyone that is
assumed for the following chapters.

*Chapter 2* is for students.
It gives advice to students and explains IIS programs that support them.
Issues like composing a committee, getting letters, or working with faculty
become much more
difficult when the faculty you are working with are not in your field; this
chapter should help.

*Chapter 3* is for faculty.
It focuses mainly on grant sponsored research activities and the resources
that the IIS provides to increase success.

*Chapter 4* is for staff.
It outlines cyclical procedures as well as procedures triggered by aperiodic
events.
