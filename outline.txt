Faculty interested in leading the seminar are encouraged to contact the IIS Director.
The seminar provides an excellent venue for new faculty hires or IIS Affiliates to
engage other faculty and students in their research area, as well as cover hot
new emerging areas.

The IIS provides material and staff support for the seminar, currently {cogsci-funding}
for external speaker travel costs and support from {cogsci-travel} for travel arrangements.
This support also covers external speaker lunches with graduate students (arranged by IISSO)
and dinners with interested IIS Affiliates.
